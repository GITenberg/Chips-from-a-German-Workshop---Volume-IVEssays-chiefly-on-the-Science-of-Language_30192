ON THE VALUE OF COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY<br>
AS A BRANCH OF ACADEMIC STUDY.</span></h3>

<h6>DELIVERED BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD<br>
THE 27TH OF OCTOBER, 1868.</h6>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> foundation of a professorial
chair in the University of Oxford marks an important epoch in the
history of every new science.<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_1" id =
"tagI_1" href = "#noteI_1">1</a> There are other universities far more
ready to confer this academical
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<a name = "page2" id = "page2"> </a>
recognition on new branches of scientific research, and it would be easy
to mention several subjects, and no doubt important subjects, which have
long had their accredited representatives in the universities of France
and Germany, but which at Oxford have not yet received this well-merited
recognition.</p>

<p>If we take into account the study of ancient languages only, we see
that as soon as Champollion’s discoveries had given to the study of
hieroglyphics and Egyptian antiquities a truly scientific character, the
French government thought it its duty to found a chair for this
promising branch of Oriental scholarship. Italy soon followed this
generous example: nor was the Prussian government long behind hand in
doing honor to the newborn science, as soon as in Professor Lepsius it
had found a scholar worthy to occupy a chair of Egyptology at
Berlin.</p>

<p>If France had possessed the brilliant genius to whom so much is due
in the deciphering of the cuneiform inscriptions, I&nbsp;have little
doubt that long ago a chair would have been founded at the <i>Collège de
France</i> expressly for Sir Henry Rawlinson.</p>

<p>England possesses some of the best, if not the best, of Persian
scholars (alas! he who was here in my mind, Lord Strangford, is no
longer among&nbsp;us), yet there is no chair for Persian at Oxford or
Cambridge, in spite of the charms of its modern literature, and the vast
importance of the ancient language of Persia and Bactria, the Zend,
a&nbsp;language full of interest, not only to the comparative
philologist, but also to the student of Comparative Theology.</p>

<p>There are few of the great universities of Europe without a chair for
that language which, from the very beginning of history, as far as it is
known to us,
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<a name = "page3" id = "page3"> </a>
seems always to have been spoken by the largest number of human
beings,&mdash;I mean Chinese. In Paris we find not one, but two chairs
for Chinese, one for the ancient, another for the modern language of
that wonderful empire; and if we consider the light which a study of
that curious form of human speech is intended to throw on the nature and
growth of language, if we measure the importance of its enormous
literature by the materials which it supplies to the student of ancient
religions, and likewise to the historian who wishes to observe the
earliest rise of the principal sciences and arts in countries beyond the
influence of Aryan and Semitic civilization,&mdash;if, lastly, we take
into account the important evidence which the Chinese language,
reflecting, like a never-fading photograph, the earliest workings of the
human mind, is able to supply to the student of psychology, and to the
careful analyzer of the elements and laws of thought, we should feel
less inclined to ignore or ridicule the claims of such a language to a
chair in our ancient university.<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_2" id =
"tagI_2" href = "#noteI_2">2</a></p>

<p>I could go on and mention several other subjects, well worthy of the
same distinction. If the study of Celtic languages and Celtic
antiquities deserves to be encouraged anywhere, it is surely in
England,&mdash;not, as has been suggested, in order to keep English
literature from falling into the abyss of German platitudes, nor to put
Aneurin and Taliesin in the place of Shakespeare and Burns, and to
counteract by their “suavity and brilliancy” the Philistine tendencies
of the Saxon and the Northman, but in order to
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page4" id = "page4"> </a>
supply sound materials and guiding principles to the critical student of
the ancient history and the ancient language of Britain, to excite an
interest in what still remains of Celtic antiquities, whether in
manuscripts or in genuine stone monuments, and thus to preserve such
national heir-looms from neglect or utter destruction. If we consider
that Oxford possesses a Welsh college, and that England possesses the
best of Celtic scholars, it is surely a pity that he should have to
publish the results of his studies in the short intervals of official
work at Calcutta, and not in the more congenial atmosphere of
Rytichin.</p>

<p>For those who know the history of the ancient universities of
England, it is not difficult to find out why they should have been less
inclined than their continental sisters to make timely provision for the
encouragement of these and other important branches of linguistic
research. Oxford and Cambridge, as independent corporations, withdrawn
alike from the support and from the control of the state, have always
looked upon the instruction of the youth of England as their proper
work; and nowhere has the tradition of classical learning been handed
down more faithfully from one generation to another than in England;
nowhere has its generous spirit more thoroughly pervaded the minds of
statesmen, poet, artists, and moulded the character of that large and
important class of independent and cultivated men, without which this
country would cease to be what it has been for the last two centuries,
a&nbsp;<i>res publica</i>, a commonwealth, in the best sense of the
word. Oxford and Cambridge have supplied what England expected or
demanded, and as English parents did not send their sons to learn
Chinese or to study
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<a name = "page5" id = "page5"> </a>
Cornish, there was naturally no supply where there was no demand. The
professorial element in the university, the true representative of
higher learning and independent research, withered away; the tutorial
assumed the vastest proportions during this and the last centuries.</p>

<p>But looking back to the earlier history of the English universities,
I&nbsp;believe it is a mistake to suppose that Oxford, one of the most
celebrated universities during the Middle Ages and in the modern history
of Europe, could ever have ignored the duty, so fully recognized by
other European universities, of not only handing down intact, and laid
up, as it were, in a napkin, the traditional stock of human knowledge,
but of constantly adding to it, and increasing it fivefold and tenfold.
Nay, unless I am much mistaken, there was really no university in which
more ample provision had been made by founders and benefactors than at
Oxford, for the support and encouragement of a class of students who
should follow up new lines of study, devote their energies to work
which, from its very nature, could not be lucrative or even
self-supporting, and maintain the fame of English learning, English
industry, and English genius in that great and time-honoured republic of
learning which claims the allegiance of the whole of Europe, nay, of the
whole civilized world. That work at Oxford and Cambridge was meant to be
done by the Fellows of Colleges. In times, no doubt, when every kind of
learning was in the hands of the clergy, these fellowships might seem to
have been intended exclusively for the support of theological students.
But when other studies, once mere germs and shoots on the tree of
knowledge, separated from the old stem and
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<a name = "page6" id = "page6"> </a>
assumed an independent growth, whether under the name of natural
science, or history, or scholarship, or jurisprudence, a&nbsp;fair
division ought to have been made at once of the funds which, in
accordance with the letter, it may be, but certainly not with the spirit
of the ancient statutes, have remained for so many years appropriated to
the exclusive support of theological learning, if learning it could be
called. Fortunately, that mistake has now been remedied, and the funds
originally intended, without distinction, for the support of “true
religion and useful learning,” are now again more equally apportioned
among those who, in the age in which we live, have divided and
subdivided the vast intellectual inheritance of the Middle Ages, in
order to cultivate the more thoroughly every nook and every corner in
the boundless field of human knowledge.</p>

<p>Something, however, remains still to be done in order to restore
these fellowships more fully and more efficiently to their original
purpose, and thus to secure to the university not only a staff of
zealous teachers, which it certainly possesses, but likewise a class of
independent workers, of men who, by original research, by critical
editions of the classics, by an acquisition of a scholarlike knowledge
of other languages besides Greek and Latin, by an honest devotion to one
or the other among the numerous branches of physical science, by
fearless researches into the ancient history of mankind, by a careful
collection or revision of the materials for the history of politics,
jurisprudence, medicine, literature, and arts, by a life-long occupation
with the problems of philosophy, and last, not least, by a real study of
theology, or the science of religion, should perform again those duties
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<a name = "page7" id = "page7"> </a>
which in the stillness of the Middle Ages were performed by learned
friars within the walls of our colleges. Those duties have remained in
abeyance for several generations, and they must now be performed with
increased vigor, in order to retain for Oxford that high position which
it once held, not simply as a place of education, but as a seat of
learning, amid the most celebrated universities of Europe.</p>

<p>“<i>Noblesse oblige</i>” is an old saying that is sometimes addressed
to those who have inherited an illustrious name, and who are proud of
their ancestors. But what are the ancestors of the oldest and proudest
of families compared with the ancestors of this university! “<i>Noblesse
oblige</i>” applies to Oxford at the present moment more than ever, when
knowledge for its own sake, and a chivalrous devotion to studies which
command no price in the fair of the world, and lead to no places of
emolument in church or state, are looked down upon and ridiculed by
almost everybody.</p>

<p>There is no career in England at the present moment for scholars and
students. No father could honestly advise his son, whatever talent he
might display, to devote himself exclusively to classical, historical,
or physical studies. The few men who still keep up the fair name of
England by independent research and new discoveries in the fields of
political and natural history, do not always come from our universities;
and unless they possess independent means, they cannot devote more than
the leisure hours, left by their official duties in church or state, to
the prosecution of their favorite studies. This ought not to be, nor
need it be so. If only twenty men in Oxford and Cambridge had the will,
everything
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<a name = "page8" id = "page8"> </a>
is ready for a reform, that is, for a restoration of the ancient glory
of Oxford. The funds which are now frittered away in so-called
prize-fellowships, would enable the universities to-morrow to invite the
best talent of England back to its legitimate home. And what should we
lose if we had no longer that long retinue of non-resident fellows? It
is true, no doubt, that a fellowship has been a help in the early career
of many a poor and hard-working man, and how could it be otherwise? But
in many cases I know that it has proved a drag rather than a spur for
further efforts. Students at English universities belong, as a rule, to
the wealthier classes, and England is the wealthiest country in Europe.
Yet in no country in the world would a young man, after his education is
finished, expect assistance from public sources. Other countries tax
themselves to the utmost in order to enable the largest possible number
of young men to enjoy the best possible education in schools and
universities. But when that is done the community feels that it has
fulfilled its duty, and it says to the young generation, Now swim or
drown. A&nbsp;manly struggle against poverty, it may be even against
actual hunger, will form a stronger and sounder metal than a
lotus-eating club-life in London or Paris. Whatever fellowships were
intended to be, they were never intended to be mere sinecures, as most
of them are at present. It is a national blessing that the two ancient
universities of England should have saved such large funds from the
shipwreck that swallowed up the corporate funds of the continental
universities. But, in order to secure their safety for the future, it is
absolutely necessary that these funds should be utilized again for the
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<a name = "page9" id = "page9"> </a>
advancement of learning. Why should not a fellowship be made into a
career for life, beginning with little, but rising like the incomes of
other professions? Why should the grotesque condition of celibacy be
imposed on a fellowship, instead of the really salutary condition
of&mdash;No work, no pay? Why should not some special literary or
scientific work be assigned to each fellow, whether resident in Oxford
or sent abroad on scientific missions? Why, instead of having fifty
young men scattered about in England, should we not have ten of the best
workers in every branch of human <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘knowlege’">knowledge</ins> resident at Oxford, whether as
teachers, or as guides, or as examples? The very presence of such men
would have a stimulating and elevating effect: it would show to the
young men higher objects of human ambition than the baton of a
field-marshal, the mitre of a bishop, the ermine of a judge, or the
money bags of a merchant; it would create for the future a supply of new
workers as soon as there was for them, if not an avenue to wealth and
power, at least a fair opening for hard work and proper pay. All this
might be done to-morrow, without any injury to anybody, and with every
chance of producing results of the greatest value to the universities,
to the country, and to the world at large. Let the university continue
to do the excellent work which it does at present as a teacher, but let
it not forget the equally important duty of a university, that of a
worker. Our century has inherited the intellectual wealth of former
centuries, and with it the duty, not only to preserve it or to dole it
out in schools and universities, but to increase it far beyond the
limits which it has reached at present. Where there is no advance, there
is retrogression: rest is impossible for the human mind.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<a name = "page10" id = "page10"> </a>
<p>Much of the work, therefore, which in other universities falls to the
lot of the professors, ought, in Oxford, to be performed by a staff of
student-fellows, whose labors should be properly organized as they are
in the Institute of France or in the Academy of Berlin. With or without
teaching, they could perform the work which no university can safely
neglect, the work of constantly testing the soundness of our
intellectual food, and of steadily expanding the realms of knowledge. We
want pioneers, explorers, conquerors, and we could have them in
abundance if we cared to have them. What other universities do by
founding new chairs for new sciences, the colleges of Oxford could do
to-morrow by applying the funds which are not required for teaching
purposes, and which are now spent on sinecure fellowships, for making
either temporary or permanent provision for the endowment of original
research.</p>

<p>It is true that new chairs have, from time to time, been founded in
Oxford also; but if we inquire into the circumstances under which
provision was made for the teaching of new subjects, we shall find that
it generally took place, not so much for the encouragement of any new
branch of scientific research, however interesting to the philosopher
and the historian, as in order to satisfy some practical wants that
could no longer be ignored, whether in church or state, or in the
university itself.</p>

<p>Confining ourselves to the chairs of languages, or, as they used to
be called, “the readerships of tongues,” we find that as early as 1311,
while the Crusades were still fresh in the memory of the people of
Europe, an appeal was made by Pope Clement&nbsp;V. at the Council of
Vienne, calling upon the principal
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<a name = "page11" id = "page11"> </a>
universities in Christendom to appoint lecturers for the study of
Hebrew, Arabic, and Chaldaic. It was considered at the time a great
honor for Oxford to be mentioned by name, together with Paris, Bologna,
and Salamanca, as one of the four great seats of learning in which the
Pope and the Council of Vienne desired that provision should be made for
the teaching of these languages. It is quite clear, however, from the
wording of the resolution of the Council,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagI_3" id = "tagI_3" href = "#noteI_3">3</a> that the chief object in
the foundation of these readerships was to supply men capable of
defending the interests of the church, of taking an active part in the
controversies with Jews and Mohammedans, who were then considered
dangerous, and of propagating the faith among unbelievers.</p>

<p>Nor does it seem that this papal exhortation produced much effect,
for we find that Henry VIII. in 1540 had to make new provision in order
to secure efficient teachers of Hebrew and Greek in the University of
Oxford. At that time these two languages, but more particularly Greek,
had assumed not only a theological, but a political importance, and it
was but natural that the king should do all in his power to foster and
spread a knowledge of a language which had been one of the most powerful
weapons in the hands of the reformers. At Oxford itself this new chair
was by no means popular: on the contrary those who studied Greek were
for a
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page12" id = "page12"> </a>
long time looked upon with great suspicion and dislike.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagI_4" id = "tagI_4" href = "#noteI_4">4</a></p>

<p>Henry VIII. did nothing for the support of Arabic; but a century
later (1636) we find Archbishop Laud, whose attention had been attracted
by Eastern questions, full of anxiety to resuscitate the study of Arabic
at Oxford, partly by collecting Arabic MSS. in the East and depositing
them in the Bodleian Library, partly by founding a new chair of Arabic,
inaugurated by Pococke, and rendered illustrious by such names as
Greaves, Thomas Hyde, John Wallis, and Thomas Hunt.</p>

<p>The foundation of a chair of Anglo-Saxon, too, was due, not so much
to a patriotic interest excited by the ancient national literature of
the Saxons, still less to the importance of that ancient language for
philological studies, but it received its first impulse from the divines
of the sixteenth century, who wished to strengthen the position of the
English Church in its controversy with the Church of Rome. Under the
auspices of Archbishop Parker, Anglo-Saxon MSS. were first collected,
and the Anglo-Saxon translations of the Bible, as well as Anglo-Saxon
homilies, and treatises on theological and ecclesiastical subjects were
studied by Fox, the martyrologist, and others,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagI_5" id = "tagI_5" href = "#noteI_5">5</a> to be quoted as witnesses
to the purity and simplicity of the primitive church founded in this
realm, free in its origin from the later faults and fancies of the
Church of Rome. Without
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<a name = "page13" id = "page13"> </a>
this practical object, Anglo-Saxon would hardly have excited so much
interest in the sixteenth century, and Oxford would probably have
remained much longer without its professorial chair of the ancient
national language of England, which was founded by Rawlinson, but was
not inaugurated before the end of the last century (1795).</p>

<p>Of the two remaining chairs of languages, of Sanskrit and of Latin,
the former owes its origin, not to an admiration of the classical
literature of India, nor to a recognition of the importance of Sanskrit
for the purposes of Comparative Philology, but to an express desire on
the part of its founder to provide efficient missionaries for India;
while the creation of a chair of Latin, though long delayed, was at last
rendered imperative by the urgent wants of the university.</p>

<p>Nor does the chair of Comparative Philology, just founded by the
university, form altogether an exception to this general rule. It is
curious to remark that while Comparative Philology has for more than
half a century excited the deepest interest, not only among continental,
but likewise among English scholars, and while chairs of this new
science have been founded long ago in almost every university of France,
Germany, and Italy, the foundation of a new chair of Comparative
Philology at Oxford should coincide very closely with a decided change
that has taken place in the treatment of that science, and which has
given to its results a more practical importance for the study of Greek
and Latin, such as could hardly be claimed for it during the first fifty
years of its growth.</p>

<p>We may date the origin of Comparative Philology,
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page14" id = "page14"> </a>
as distinct from the Science of Language, from the foundation of the
Asiatic Society of Calcutta, in 1784. From that time dates the study of
Sanskrit, and it was the study of Sanskrit which formed the foundation
of Comparative Philology.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that Sanskrit had been studied before by
Italian, German, and French missionaries; it is likewise perfectly true
that several of these missionaries were fully aware of the close
relationship between Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin. A&nbsp;man must be
blind who, after looking at a Sanskrit grammar, does not see at once the
striking coincidences between the declensions and conjugations of the
classical language of India and those of Greece and Italy.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagI_6" id = "tagI_6" href = "#noteI_6">6</a></p>

<p>Filippo Sassetti, who spent some time at Goa, between 1581 and 1588,
had only acquired a very slight knowledge of Sanskrit before he wrote
home to his friends “that it has many words in common with Italian,
particularly in the numerals, in the names for God, serpent, and many
others.” This was in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Some of the Jesuit missionaries, however, went far beyond this.
A&nbsp;few among them had acquired a real and comprehensive knowledge of
the ancient language and literature of India, and we see them anticipate
in their letters several of the most brilliant discoveries of Sir W.
Jones and Professor Bopp. The père Cœurdoux,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagI_7" id = "tagI_7" href = "#noteI_7">7</a> a&nbsp;French Jesuit,
writes in 1767 from Pondichery to the French Academy, asking that
learned society for a solution of the question, “<i>How is it that
Sanskrit has so many words in common
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<a name = "page15" id = "page15"> </a>
with Greek and Latin?</i>” He presents not only long lists of words, but
he calls attention to the still more curious fact, that the grammatical
forms in Sanskrit show the most startling similarity with Greek and
Latin. After him almost everybody who had looked at Sanskrit, and who
knew Greek and Latin, made the same remark and asked the same
question.</p>

<p>But the fire only smouldered on; it would not burn up, it would not
light, it would not warm. At last, owing to the exertions of the
founders of the Asiatic Society at Calcutta, the necessary materials for
a real study of Sanskrit became accessible to the students of Europe.
The voice of Frederick Schlegel roused the attention of the world at
large to the startling problem that had been thrown into the arena of
the intellectual chivalry of the world, and at last the glove was taken
up, and men like Bopp, and Burnouf, and Pott, and Grimm, did not rest
till some answer could be returned, and some account rendered of
Sanskrit, that strange intruder, and great disturber of the peace of
classical scholarship.</p>

<p>The work which then began, was incessant. It was not enough that some
words in Greek and Latin should be traced in Sanskrit. A&nbsp;kind of
silent conviction began to spread that there must be in Sanskrit a
remedy for all evils; people could not rest till every word in Greek and
Latin had, in some disguise or other, been discovered in Sanskrit. Nor
were Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit enough to satisfy the thirst of the new
discoverers. The Teutonic languages were soon annexed, the Celtic
languages yielded to some gentle pressure, the Slavonic languages
clamored for incorporation, the sacred idiom
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<a name = "page16" id = "page16"> </a>
of ancient Persia, the Zend, demanded its place by the side of Sanskrit,
the Armenian followed in its wake; and when even the Ossetic from the
valleys of Mount Caucasus, and the Albanian from the ancient hills of
Epirus, had proved their birthright, the whole family, the Aryan family
of language, seemed complete, and an historical fact, the original unity
of all these languages, was established on a basis which even the most
skeptical could not touch or shake. Scholars rushed in as diggers rush
into a new gold field, picking up whatever is within reach, and trying
to carry off more than they could carry, so that they might be foremost
in the race, and claim as their own all that they had been the first to
look at or to touch. There was a rush, and now and then an ugly rush,
and when the armfuls of nuggets that were thrown down before the world
in articles, pamphlets, essays, and ponderous volumes, came to be more
carefully examined, it was but natural that not everything that
glittered should turn out to be gold. Even in the works of more critical
scholars, such as Bopp, Burnouf, Pott, and Benfey, at least in those
which were published in the first enthusiasm of discovery, many things
may now be pointed out, which no assayer would venture to pass. It was
the great merit of Bopp that he called the attention away from this
tempting field to the more laborious work of grammatical analysis,
though even in his Comparative Grammar, in that comprehensive survey of
the grammatical outlines of the Aryan languages, the spirit of conquest
and centralization still predominates. All languages are, if possible,
to submit to the same laws; what is common to all of them is welcome,
what is peculiar to each is treated as anomalous, or explained as the
result of later corruption.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page17" id = "page17"> </a>
<p>This period in the history of Comparative Philology has sometimes
been characterized as <i>syncretistic</i>, and to a certain extent that
name and the censure implied in it are justified. But to a very small
extent only. It was in the nature of things that a comparative study of
languages should at first be directed to what is common to all; nay,
without having first become thoroughly acquainted with the general
features of the whole family, it would have been impossible to discover
and fully to appreciate what is peculiar to each of the members.</p>

<p>Nor was it long before a reaction set in. One scholar from the very
first, and almost contemporaneously with Bopp’s first essays on
Comparative Grammar, devoted himself to the study of one branch of
languages only, availing himself, as far as he was able, of the new
light which a knowledge of Sanskrit had thrown on the secret history of
the whole Aryan family of speech, but concentrating his energies on the
Teutonic; I&nbsp;mean, of course, Jacob Grimm, the author of the great
historical grammar of the German language; a&nbsp;work which will live
and last long after other works of that early period shall have been
forgotten, or replaced, at least, by better books.</p>

<p>After a time Grimm’s example was followed by others. Zeuss, in his
“Grammatica Celtica,” established the study of the Celtic languages on
the broad foundations of Comparative Grammar. Miklosich and Schleicher
achieved similar results by adopting the same method for the study of
the Slavonic dialects. Curtius, by devoting himself to an elucidation of
Greek, opened the eyes of classical scholars to the immense advantages
of this new treatment of grammar and etymology; while Corssen, in his
more
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<a name = "page18" id = "page18"> </a>
recent works on Latin, has struck a mine which may well tempt the
curiosity of every student of the ancient dialects of Italy. At the
present moment the reaction is complete; and there is certainly some
danger, lest what was called a <i>syncretistic</i> spirit should now be
replaced by an <i>isolating</i> spirit in the science of language.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied, however, that this isolating, or rather
discriminating, tendency has produced already the most valuable results,
and I believe that it is chiefly due to the works of Curtius and
Corssen, if Greek and Latin scholars have been roused at last from their
apathy and been made aware of the absolute necessity of Comparative
Philology, as a subject to be taught, not only in every university but
in every school. I&nbsp;believe it is due to their works that a
conviction has gradually been gaining ground among the best scholars at
Oxford, also, that Comparative Philology could no longer be ignored as
an important ingredient in the teaching of Greek and Latin; and while a
comparative analysis of Sanskrit, Zend, Armenian, Greek, Latin, Gothic,
High-German, Lithuanian, Slavonic, and Celtic, such as we find it in
Bopp’s “Comparative Grammar,” would hardly be considered as a subject of
practical utility, even in a school of philology, it was recognized at
last that, not only for sound principles of etymology, not only for a
rational treatment of Greek and Latin grammar, not only for a right
understanding of classical mythology, but even for a critical
restoration of the very texts of Homer and Plautus, a&nbsp;knowledge of
Comparative Philology, as applied to Greek and Latin, had become
indispensable.</p>

<p>My chief object, therefore, as Professor of Comparative
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<a name = "page19" id = "page19"> </a>
Philology at Oxford, will be to treat the classical languages under that
new aspect which they have assumed, as viewed by the microscope of
Curtius and Corssen, rather than by the telescope of Bopp, Pott, and
Benfey. I&nbsp;shall try not only to give results, but to explain what
is far more important, the method by which these results were obtained,
so far as this is possible without, for the present at least,
presupposing among my hearers a knowledge of Sanskrit. Sanskrit
certainly forms the only sound foundation of Comparative Philology, and
it will always remain the only safe guide through all its intricacies.
A&nbsp;comparative philologist without a knowledge of Sanskrit is like
an astronomer without a knowledge of mathematics. He may admire, he may
observe, he may discover, but he will never feel satisfied, he will
never feel certain, he will never feel quite at home.</p>

<p>I hope, therefore, that, besides those who attend my public lectures,
there will be at least a few to form a private class for the study of
the elements of Sanskrit. Sanskrit, no doubt, is a very difficult
language, and it requires the study of a whole life to master its
enormous literature. Its grammar, too, has been elaborated with such
incredible minuteness by native grammarians, that I am not surprised if
many scholars who begin the study of Sanskrit turn back from it in
dismay. But it is quite possible to learn the rules of Sanskrit
declension and conjugation, and to gain an insight into the grammatical
organization of that language, without burdening one’s memory with all
the phonetic rules which generally form the first chapter of every
Sanskrit grammar, or without devoting years of study to the unraveling
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page20" id = "page20"> </a>
of the intricacies of the greatest of Indian, if not of all
grammarians,&mdash;<span class = "sanskrit">Pâṇini</span>. There are but
few among our very best comparative philologists who are able to
understand <span class = "sanskrit">Pâṇini</span>. Professor Benfey,
whose powers of work are truly astounding, stands almost alone in his
minute knowledge of that greatest of all grammarians. Neither Bopp, nor
Pott, nor Curtius, nor Corssen, ever attempted to master <span class =
"sanskrit">Pâṇini’s</span> wonderful system. But a study of Sanskrit, as
taught by European grammarians, cannot be recommended too strongly to
all students of language. A&nbsp;good sailor may, for a time, steer
without a compass, but even he feels safer when he knows that he may
consult it, if necessary; and whenever he comes near the
rocks,&mdash;and there are many in the Aryan sea,&mdash;he will hardly
escape shipwreck without this magnetic needle.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagI_8" id = "tagI_8" href = "#noteI_8">8,</a><a class = "tag" href =
"#chapI_noteA">A,</a><a class = "tag" href = "#chapI_noteB">B</a></p>

<p>It will be asked, no doubt, by Greek and Latin scholars who have
never as yet devoted themselves seriously to a study of Comparative
Philology, what is to be gained after all the trouble of learning
Sanskrit, and after mastering the works of Bopp, and Benfey, and
Curtius? Would a man be a better Greek and Latin scholar for knowing
Sanskrit? Would he write better Latin and Greek verse? Would he be
better able to read and compare Greek and Latin MSS., and to prepare a
critical edition of classical authors? To all these questions I reply
both <i>No</i> and <i>Yes</i>.</p>

<p>If there is one branch of classical philology where the advantages
derived from Comparative Philology have been most readily admitted, it
is etymology. More than fifty years ago, Otfried Müller told classical
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<a name = "page21" id = "page21"> </a>
scholars that that province at least must be surrendered. And yet it is
strange to see how long it takes before old erroneous derivations are
exploded and finally expelled from our dictionaries; and how, in spite
of all warnings, similarity of sound and similarity of meaning are still
considered the chief criteria of Greek and Latin etymologies. I&nbsp;do
not address this reproach to classical scholars only; it applies equally
to many comparative philologists who, for the sake of some striking
similarity of sound and meaning, will now and then break the phonetic
laws which they themselves have helped to establish.</p>

<p>If we go back to earlier days, we find that Sanskrit scholars who had
discovered that one of the names of the god of love in Bengali was
<i>Dipuc</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the inflamer, derived from it by inversion the
name of the god of love in Latin, <i>Cupid</i>. Sir William Jones
identified <i>Janus</i> with the Sanskrit <em class =
"sanskrit">Gaṇeśa</em>, <i>i.e.</i>, lord of hosts,<a class = "tag" name
= "tagI_9" id = "tagI_9" href = "#noteI_9">9</a> and even later scholars
allowed themselves to be tempted to see the Indian prototype of
<i>Ganymedes</i> in the <em class = "sanskrit">Kaṇva-medhâtithi</em> or
<em class = "sanskrit">Kaṇva-mesha</em> of the Veda.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagI_10" id = "tagI_10" href = "#noteI_10">10</a></p>

<p>After the phonetic laws of each language had been more carefully
elaborated, it was but too frequently forgotten that words have a
history as well as a growth, and that the history of a word must be
explored first, before an attempt is made to unravel its growth. Thus it
was extremely tempting to derive <i>paradise</i> from the Sanskrit
<em>paradeśa</em>. The compound <em>para-deśa</em> was supposed to mean
the highest or a distant country, and all the rest seemed so evident as
to require no further elucidation. <em>Paradeśa</em>,
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page22" id = "page22"> </a>
however, does not mean the highest or a distant country in Sanskrit, but
is always used in the sense of a foreign country, an enemy’s country.
Further, as early as the Song of Solomon (iv.&nbsp;13), the word occurs
in Hebrew as <i>pardés</i>, and how it could have got there straight
from Sanskrit requires, at all events, some historical explanation. In
Hebrew the word might have been borrowed from Persian, but the Sanskrit
word <em>paradeśa</em>, if it existed at all in Persian, would have been
<i>paradaesa</i>, the <i>s</i> being a guttural, not a dental sibilant.
Such a compound, however, does not exist in Persian, and therefore the
Sanskrit word <em>paradeśa</em> could not have reached Hebrew <i>viâ</i>
Persia.</p>

<p>It is true, nevertheless, that the ancient Hebrew word <i>pardés</i>
is borrowed from Persian, viz.: from the Zend <i>pairidaêza</i>, which
means <i>circumvallatio</i>, a piece of ground inclosed by high walls,
afterwards a park, a&nbsp;garden.<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_11" id =
"tagI_11" href = "#noteI_11">11</a> The root in Sanskrit is DIH or DHIH
(for Sanskrit <i>h</i> is Zend <i>z</i>), and means originally to knead,
to squeeze together, to shape. From it we have the Sanskrit
<em>dehî</em>, a wall, while in Greek the same root, according to the
strictest phonetic rules, yielded <span class = "greek" title =
"toichos">τοῖχος</span>, wall. In Latin our root is regularly changed
into <i>fig</i>, and gives us <i>figulus</i>, a potter, <i>figura</i>,
form or shape, and <i>fingere</i>. In Gothic it could only appear as
<i>deig-an</i>, to knead, to form anything out of soft substances; hence
<i>daig-s</i>, the English <i>dough</i>, German <i>Deich</i>.</p>

<p>But the Greek <span class = "greek" title =
"paradeisos">παράδεισος</span> did not come from Hebrew, because here
again there is no historical bridge between the two languages. In Greek
we trace the word to Xenophon, who brought it back from his
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<a name = "page23" id = "page23"> </a>
repeated journeys in Persia, and who uses it in the sense of
pleasure-ground, or deer park.<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_12" id =
"tagI_12" href = "#noteI_12">12</a></p>

<p>Lastly, we find the same word used in the LXX., as the name given to
the garden of Eden, the word having been borrowed either a third time
from Persia, or taken from the Greek, and indirectly from the works of
Xenophon.</p>

<p>This is the real history of the word. It is an Aryan word, but it
does not exist in Sanskrit. It was first formed in Zend, transferred
from thence as a foreign word into Hebrew and again into Greek. Its
modern Persian form is <i>firdaus</i>.</p>

<p>All this is matter of history rather than philology. Yet we read in
one of the best classical dictionaries: “The root of <span class =
"greek" title = "paradeisos">παράδεισος</span> appears to be Semitic,
Arab. <i>firdaus</i>, Hebr. <i>pardês</i>: borrowed, also, in Sanskrit
<em>paradêśa</em>.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_13" id = "tagI_13" href
= "#noteI_13">13</a> Nearly every word is wrong.</p>

<p>From the same root DIH springs the Sanskrit word <em>deha</em>, body;
body, like figure, being conceived as that which is formed or shaped.
Bopp identified this <em>deha</em> with Gothic <i>leik</i>, body,
particularly dead body, the modern German <i>Leiche</i> and
<i>Leichnam</i>, the English <i>lich</i> in <i>lich-gate</i>. In this
case the master of Comparative Philology disregarded the phonetic laws
which he had himself helped to establish. The transition of <i>d</i>
into <i>l</i> is no doubt common enough as between Sanskrit, Latin, and
Greek, but it has never been established as yet on good evidence as
taking place between Sanskrit and Gothic. Besides, the Sanskrit <i>h</i>
ought in Gothic to appear as <i>g</i>, as we have it in <i>deig-s</i>,
dough, and not by a tenuis.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page24" id = "page24"> </a>
<p>Another Sanskrit word for body is <em>kalevara</em>, and this proved
again a stumbling-block to Bopp, who compares it with the Latin
<i>cadaver</i>. Here one might plead that <i>l</i> and <i>d</i> are
frequently interchanged in Sanskrit and Latin words, but, as far as our
evidence goes at present, we have no doubt many cases where an original
Sanskrit <i>d</i> is represented in Latin by <i>l</i>, but no really
trustworthy instance in which an original Sanskrit <i>l</i> appears in
Latin as <i>d</i>. Besides, the Sanskrit diphthong <i>e</i> cannot, as a
rule, in Latin be represented by long <i>â</i>.</p>

<p>If such things could happen to Bopp, we must not be too severe on
similar breaches of the peace committed by classical scholars. What
classical scholars seem to find most difficult to learn is that there
are various degrees of certainty in etymologies even in those proposed
by our best comparative scholars, and that not everything that is
mentioned by Bopp, or Pott, or Benfey as possible, as plausible, as
probable, and even as more than probable, ought, therefore, to be set
down, for instance, in a grammar or dictionary, as simply a matter of
fact. With certain qualifications, an etymology may have a scientific
value; without those qualifications, it may become not only unscientific
but mischievous. Again, nothing seems a more difficult lesson for an
etymologist to learn than to say, I&nbsp;do not know. Yet to my mind,
nothing shows, for instance, the truly scholarlike mind of Professor
Curtius better than the very fact for which he has been so often blamed,
viz.: his passing over in silence the words about which he has nothing
certain to say.</p>

<p>Let us take an instance. If we open our best Greek dictionaries, we
find that the Greek <span class = "greek" title = "augê">αὐγή</span>,
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<a name = "page25" id = "page25"> </a>
light, splendor, is compared with the German word for eye, <i>Auge</i>.
No doubt every letter in the two words is the same, and the meaning of
the Greek word could easily be supposed to have been specialized or
localized in German. Sophocles (“Aj.”&nbsp;70) speaks of <span class =
"greek" title = "ommatôn augai">ὀμμάτων αὐγαί</span>, the lights of the
eyes, and Euripides (“Andr.” 1180) uses <span class = "greek" title =
"augai">αὐγαί</span> by itself for eyes, like the Latin <i>lumina</i>.
The verb <span class = "greek" title = "augazô">αὐγαζω</span>, too, is
used in Greek in the sense of seeing or viewing. Why, then, it was
asked, should <span class = "greek" title = "augê">αὐγή</span> not be
referred to the same source as the German <i>Auge</i>, and why should
not both be traced back to the same root that yielded the Latin
<i>oc-ulus</i>? As long as we trust to our ears, or to what is
complacently called common sense, it would seem mere fastidiousness to
reject so evident an etymology. But as soon as we know the real
chemistry of vowels and consonants, we shrink instinctly from such
combinations. If a German word has the same sound as a Greek word, the
two words cannot be the same, unless we ignore that independent process
of phonetic growth which made Greek Greek, and German German. Whenever
we find in Greek a media, a&nbsp;<i>g</i>, we expect in Gothic the
corresponding tenuis. Thus the root <i>gan</i>, which we have in Greek
<span class = "greek" title = "gignôskô">γιγνώσκω</span>, is in Gothic
<i>kann</i>. The Greek <span class = "greek" title = "gonu">γόνυ</span>,
Lat. <i>genu</i>, is in Gothic <i>kniu</i>. If, therefore, <span class =
"greek" title = "augê">αὐγή</span> existed in Gothic it would be
<i>auko</i>, and not <i>augo</i>. Secondly, the diphthong <i>au</i> in
<i>augo</i> would be different from the Greek diphthong. Grimm supposed
that the Gothic <i>augo</i> came from the same etymon which yields the
Latin <i>oc-ulus</i>, the Sanskrit <em>ak-sh-i</em>, eye, the Greek
<span class = "greek" title = "osse">ὄσσε</span> for <span class =
"greek" title = "oki-e">ὄκι-ε</span>, and likewise the Greek stem <span
class = "greek" title = "op">ὀπ</span> in <span class = "greek" title =
"op-ôp-a">ὄπ-ωπ-α</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"omma">ὄμμα</span>, and <span class = "greek" title =
"oph-th-almos">ὀφ-θ-αλμός</span>. It is true that the short radical
vowel <i>a</i> in Sanskrit, <i>o</i> in Greek,
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<a name = "page26" id = "page26"> </a>
<i>u</i> in Latin, sinks down to <i>u</i> in Gothic, and it is equally
true, as Grimm has shown, that, according to a phonetic law peculiar to
Gothic, <i>u</i> before <i>h</i> and <i>r</i> is changed to <i>aú</i>.
Grimm, therefore, takes the Gothic <i>aúgô</i> for *<i>aúhô</i>, and
this for *<i>uhô</i>, which, as he shows, would be a proper
representative in Gothic of the Sanskrit <em>ak-an</em>, or
<em>aksh-an</em>.</p>

<p>But here Grimm seems wrong. If the <i>au</i> of <i>augô</i> were this
peculiar Gothic <i>aú</i>, which represents an original short <i>a</i>,
changed to <i>u</i>, and then raised to a diphthong by the insertion of
a short <i>a</i>, then that diphthong would be restricted to Gothic; and
the other Teutonic dialects would have their own representatives for an
original short <i>a</i>. But in Anglo-Saxon we find <i>eáge</i>, in Old
High German <i>augâ</i>, both pointing to a labial diphthong,
<i>i.e.</i> to a radical <i>u</i> raised to <i>au</i>.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagI_14" id = "tagI_14" href = "#noteI_14">14</a></p>

<p>Professor Ebel,<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_15" id = "tagI_15" href
= "#noteI_15">15</a> in order to avoid this difficulty, proposed a
different explanation. He supposed that the <i>k</i> of the root
<i>ak</i> was softened to <i>kv</i>, and that <i>augô</i> represents an
original <i>agvâ</i> or <i>ahvâ</i>, the <i>v</i> of <i>hvâ</i> being
inserted before the <i>h</i> and changed to <i>u</i>. As an analogous
case he quoted the Sanskrit enclitic particle <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘ka’ with no italics"><i>ca</i></ins>, Latin
<i>que</i>, Gothic *<i>hva</i>, which *<i>hva</i> appears always under
the form of <i>uh</i>. Leo Meyer takes the same view, and quotes, as an
analogon, <i>haubida</i> as possibly identical with <i>caput</i>,
originally *<i>kapvat</i>.</p>

<p>These cases, however, are not quite analogous. The enclitic particle
<em>ca</em>, in Gothic *<i>hva</i>, had to lose its final vowel. It thus
became unpronounceable, and the short vowel <i>u</i> was added simply to
facilitate
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<a name = "page27" id = "page27"> </a>
its pronunciation.<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_16" id = "tagI_16" href
= "#noteI_16">16</a> There was no such difficulty in pronouncing
*<i>ah</i> or *<i>uh</i> in Gothic, still less the derivative form
*<i>ahvô</i>, if such a form had ever existed.</p>

<p>Another explanation was therefore attempted by the late Dr.
Lottner.<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_17" id = "tagI_17" href =
"#noteI_17">17</a> He supposed that the root <i>ak</i> existed also with
a nasal as <i>ank</i>, and that <i>ankô</i> could be changed to
<i>aukô</i>, and <i>aukô</i> to <i>augô</i>. In reply to this we must
remark that in the Teutonic dialects the root <i>ak</i> never appears as
<i>ank</i>, and that the transition of <i>an</i> into <i>au</i>, though
possible under certain conditions, is not a phonetic process of frequent
occurrence.</p>

<p>Besides, in all these derivations there is a difficulty, though not a
serious one, viz.: that an original tenuis, the <i>k</i>, is supposed
irregularly to have been changed into <i>g</i>, instead of what it ought
to be, an <i>h</i>. Although this is not altogether anomalous,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagI_18" id = "tagI_18" href = "#noteI_18">18</a> yet it
has to be taken into account. Professor Curtius, therefore, though he
admits a possible connection between Gothic <i>augô</i> and the root
<i>ak</i>, speaks cautiously on the subject. On page 99 he refers to
<i>augô</i> as more distantly connected with that root, and on
p.&nbsp;457 he simply refers to the attempts of Ebel, Grassmann, and
Lottner to explain the diphthong <i>au</i>, without himself expressing
any decided opinion. Nor does he commit himself to any opinion as to the
origin of <span class = "greek" title = "augê">αὐγή</span>, though, of
course, he never thinks of connecting the two words, Gothic <i>augô</i>
and Greek <span class = "greek" title = "augê">αὐγή</span>, as coming
from the same root.</p>

<p>The etymology of the Greek <span class = "greek" title =
"augê">αὐγή</span>, in the sense of
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<a name = "page28" id = "page28"> </a>
light or splendor, is not known unless we connect it with the Sanskrit
<em>ojas</em>, which, however, means vigor rather than splendor. The
etymology of <i>oculus</i>, on the contrary, is clear; it comes from a
root <i>ak</i>, to be sharp, to point, to fix, and it is closely
connected with the Sanskrit word for eye, <em>akshi</em>, and with the
Greek <span class = "greek" title = "osse">ὄσσε</span>. The etymology of
the German word <i>Auge</i> is, as yet, unknown. All we may safely
assert is, that, in spite of the most favorable appearances, it cannot,
for the present, be traced back to the same source as either the Greek
<span class = "greek" title = "augê">αὐγή</span> or the Latin
<i>oculus</i>.</p>

<p>If we simply transliterated the Gothic <i>augô</i> into Sanskrit, we
should expect some word like <em>ohan</em>, nom. <em>ohâ</em>. The
question is, may we take the liberty, which many of the most eminent
comparative philologists allow themselves, of deriving Gothic, Greek,
and Latin words from roots which occur in Sanskrit, only, but which have
left no trace of their former presence in any other language? If so,
then there would be little difficulty in finding an etymology for the
Gothic <i>augô</i>. There is in Sanskrit a root <em>ûh</em>, which means
to watch, to spy, to look. It occurs frequently in the Veda, and from it
we have likewise a substantive, <em>oha-s</em>, look or appearance. If,
in Sanskrit itself this root had yielded a name for eye, such as
<em>ohan</em>, the instrument of looking, I&nbsp;should not hesitate for
a moment to identify this Sanskrit word <em>ohan</em> with the Gothic
<i>augô</i>. No objection could be raised on phonetic grounds.
Phonetically the two words would be one and the same. But as in Sanskrit
such a derivation has not been found, and as in Gothic the root
<em>ûh</em> never occurs, such an etymology would not be satisfactory.
The number of words of unknown origin is very considerable as yet in
Sanskrit,
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<a name = "page29" id = "page29"> </a>
in Greek, in Latin, and in every one of the Aryan languages; and it is
far better to acknowledge this fact, than to sanction the smallest
violation of any of those phonetic laws, which some have called the
straight jacket, but which are in reality, the leading strings of all
true etymology.</p>

<p>If we now turn to grammar, properly so called, and ask what
Comparative Philology has done for it, we must distinguish between two
kinds of grammatical knowledge. Grammar may be looked upon as a mere
art, and, as taught at present in most schools, it is nothing but an
art. We learn to play on a foreign language as we learn to play on a
musical instrument, and we may arrive at the highest perfection in
performing on any instrument, without having a notion of thorough bass
or the laws of harmony. For practical purposes this purely empirical
knowledge is all that is required. But though it would be a mistake to
attempt in our elementary schools to replace an empirical by a
scientific knowledge of grammar, that empirical knowledge of grammar
ought in time to be raised to a real, rational, and satisfying
knowledge, a&nbsp;knowledge not only of facts, but of reasons;
a&nbsp;knowledge that teaches us not only what grammar is, but how it
came to be what it is. To know grammar is very well, but to speak all
one’s life of gerunds and supines and infinitives, without having an
idea what these formations really are, is a kind of knowledge not quite
worthy of a scholar.</p>

<p>We laugh at people who still believe in ghosts and witches, but a
belief in infinitives and supines is not only tolerated, but inculcated
in our best schools and universities. Now, what do we really mean if we
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30" id = "page30"> </a>
speak of an infinitive? It is a time-honored name, no doubt, handed down
to us from the Middle Ages; it has its distant roots in Rome,
Alexandria, and Athens;&mdash;but has it any real kernel? Has it any
more body or substance than such names as Satyrs and Lamias?</p>

<p>Let us look at the history of the name before we look at the mischief
which it, like many other names, has caused by making people believe
that whenever there is a name there must be something behind it. The
name was invented by Greek philosophers who, in their first attempts at
classifying and giving names to the various forms of language, did not
know whether to class such forms as <span class = "greek" title =
"graphein">γράφειν</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"grapsein">γράψειν</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"grapsai">γράψαι</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"gegraphenai">γεγραφέναι</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"graphesthai">γράφεσθαι</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"grapsesthai">γράψεσθαι</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"gegraphthai">γέγραφθαι</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"grapsasthai">γράψασθαι</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"graphthênai">γραφθῆναι</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"graphthêsesthai">γραφθήσεσθαι</span>, as nouns or as verbs. They had
established for their own satisfaction the broad distinction between
nouns (<span class = "greek" title = "onomata">ὀνόματα</span>) and verbs
(<span class = "greek" title = "rhêmata">ῥήματα</span>); they had
assigned to each a definition, but, after having done so, they found
that forms like <span class = "greek" title = "graphein">γράφειν</span>
would not fit their definition either of noun or verb.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagI_19" id = "tagI_19" href = "#noteI_19">19</a> What could
they do? Some (the Stoics) represented the forms in <span class =
"greek" title = "ein">ειν</span>, etc., as a subdivision of the verb,
and introduced for them the name <span class = "greek" title = "rhêma aparemphaton">ῥῆμα ἀπαρέμφατον</span> or <span class = "greek" title =
"genikôtaton">γενικώτατον</span>. Others recognized them as a separate
part of speech, raising their number from eight to nine or ten. Others,
again, classed them under the adverb (<span class = "greek" title =
"epirrhêma">ἐπιῤῥημα</span>), as one of the eight recognized parts of
speech. The Stoics, taking their stand on Aristotle’s definition of
<span class = "greek" title = "rhêma">ῥῆμα</span>, could not but regard
the infinitive as <span class = "greek" title = "rhêma">ῥῆμα</span>,
because it implied time, past, present, or future, which was with them
recognized
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<a name = "page31" id = "page31"> </a>
as the specific characteristic of the verb (<i>Zeitwort</i>). But they
went further, and called forms such as <span class = "greek" title =
"graphein">γράφειν</span>, etc., <span class = "greek" title =
"rhêma">ῥῆμα</span>, in the highest or most general sense,
distinguishing other verbal forms, such as <span class = "greek" title =
"graphei">γράφει</span>, etc., by the names of <span class = "greek"
title = "katêgorêma">κατηγόρημα</span> or <span class = "greek" title =
"sumbama">σύμβαμα</span>. Afterwards, in the progress of grammatical
science, the definition of <span class = "greek" title =
"rhêma">ῥῆμα</span> became more explicit and complete. It was pointed
out that a verb, besides its predicative meaning (<span class = "greek"
title = "emphasis">ἔμφασις</span>), is able to<a class = "tag" name =
"tagI_20" id = "tagI_20" href = "#noteI_20">20</a> express several
additional meanings (<span class = "greek" title =
"parakolouthêmata">παρακολουθήματα</span> or <span class = "greek" title
= "paremphaseis">παρεμφάσεις</span>), viz.: not only time, as already
pointed out by Aristotle, but also person and number. The two latter
meanings, however, being absent in <span class = "greek" title =
"graphein">γράφειν</span>, this was now called <span class = "greek"
title = "rhêma aparemphaton">ῥῆμα ἀπαρέμφατον</span> (without
by-meanings), or <span class = "greek" title =
"genikôtaton">γενικώτατον</span>, and, for practical purposes, this
<span class = "greek" title = "rhêma aparemphaton">ῥῆμα
ἀπαρέμφατον</span> soon became the prototype of conjugation.</p>

<p>So far there was only confusion, arising from a want of precision in
classifying the different forms of the verb. But when the Greek
terminology was transplanted to Rome, real mischief began. Instead of
<span class = "greek" title = "rhêma genikôtaton">ῥῆμα
γενικώτατον</span>, we now find the erroneous, or, at all events,
inaccurate, translation, <i>modus infinitus</i>, and <i>infinitivus</i>
by itself. What was originally meant as an adjective belonging to <span
class = "greek" title = "rhêma">ῥῆμα</span>, became a substantive, the
infinitive, and though the question arose again and again what this
infinitive really was, whether a noun, or a verb, or an adverb; whether
a mood or not a mood; the real existence of such a thing as an
infinitive could no longer be doubted. One can hardly trust one’s eyes
in reading the
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<a name = "page32" id = "page32"> </a>
extraordinary discussions on the nature of the infinitive in grammatical
works of successive centuries up to the nineteenth. Suffice it to say
that Gottfried Hermann, the great reformer of classical grammars,
treated the infinitive again as an adverb, and, therefore, as a part of
speech belonging to the particles. We ourselves were brought up to
believe in infinitives; and to doubt the existence of this grammatical
entity would have been considered in our younger days a most dangerous
heresy.</p>

<p>And yet, how much confused thought, and how much controversy might
have been avoided, if this grammatical term of infinitive had never been
invented.<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_21" id = "tagI_21" href =
"#noteI_21">21,</a><a class = "tag" href = "#chapI_noteC">C</a>
The fact is that what we call infinitives are nothing more or less than
cases of verbal nouns, and not till they are treated as what they are
shall we ever gain an insight into the nature and the historical
development of these grammatical monsters.</p>

<p>Take the old Homeric infinitive in <span class = "greek" title =
"menai">μεναι</span>, and you find its explanation in the Sanskrit
termination <em>mane</em>, <i>i.e.</i> <em>manai</em>, the native of the
suffix <em>man</em> (not, as others suppose, the locative of a suffix
<i>mana</i>), by which a large number of nouns are formed in Sanskrit.
From <i>gnâ</i>, to know, we have <em>(g)nâman</em>, Latin
<i>(g)nomén</i>, that by which a thing is known, its name; from
<em>gan</em>, to be born, <em>gán-man</em>, birth. In Greek this suffix
man is chiefly used for forming masculine nouns, such as <span class =
"greek" title = "gnô-môn, gnô-monos">γνώ-μων, γνώ-μονος</span>,
literally a knower; <span class = "greek" title =
"tlê-môn">τλή-μων</span>, a&nbsp;sufferer; or as <span class = "greek"
title = "mên">μην</span> in <span class = "greek" title =
"poi-mên">ποι-μήν</span>, a&nbsp;shepherd, literally a feeder. In Latin,
on the contrary, <i>men</i> occurs frequently at the end of abstract
nouns in the neuter gender, such as <i>teg-men</i>, the covering, or
<i>tegu-men</i> or <i>tegi-men</i>; <i>solamen</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<a name = "page33" id = "page33"> </a>
consolation; <i>voca-men</i>, an appellation; <i>certa-men</i>, a
contest; and many more, particularly in ancient Latin; while in
classical Latin the fuller suffix <i>mentum</i> predominates. If then we
read in Homer,
<span class = "greek" title = "kunas eteuxe dôma phulassemenai">κύνας
ἔτευξε δῶμα φυλασσέμεναι</span>,
we may call
<span class = "greek" title = "phulassemenai">φυλασσέμεναι</span>
an infinitive, if we like, and translate “he made dogs to protect the
house;” but the form which we have before us, is simply a dative of an
old abstract noun in <span class = "greek" title = "men">μεν</span>, and
the original meaning was “for the protection of the house,” or “for
protecting the house;” as if we said in Latin, <i>tutamini
domum</i>.</p>

<p>The infinitives in <span class = "greek" title = "men">μεν</span> may
be corruptions of those in <span class = "greek" title =
"menai">μεναι</span>, unless we take <span class = "greek" title =
"men">μεν</span> as an archaic accusative, which, though without analogy
in Greek, would correspond to Latin accusatives like <i>tegmen</i>, and
express the general object of certain acts or movements. In Sanskrit, at
least in the Veda, infinitives in <em>mane</em> occur, such as
<em>dấ-mane</em>, to give, Greek <span class = "greek" title =
"do-menai">δό-μεναι</span>; <em>vid-máne</em>, to know, Greek <span
class = "greek" title = "wid-menai">ϝίδ-μεναι</span>.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagI_22" id = "tagI_22" href = "#noteI_22">22</a></p>

<p>The question next arises, if this is a satisfactory explanation of
the infinitives in <span class = "greek" title = "menai">μεναι</span>,
how are we to explain the infinitives in <span class = "greek" title =
"enai">εναι</span>? We find in Homer, not only <span class = "greek"
title = "imenai">ἴμεναι</span>, to go, but also <span class = "greek"
title = "ienai">ἰέναι</span>; not only <span class = "greek" title =
"emmenai">ἔμμεναι</span>, to be, but also <span class = "greek" title =
"einai">εἶναι</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class = "greek" title =
"es-enai">ἔσ-εναι</span>. Bopp simply says that the <i>m</i> is lost,
but he brings no evidence that in Greek an <i>m</i> can thus be lost
without any provocation. The real explanation, here, as elsewhere, is
supplied by the <i>Beieinander</i> (the collateral growth), not by the
<i>Nacheinander</i> (the successive growth) of language. Besides the
suffix <i>man</i>, the Aryan languages possessed two other suffixes,
<i>van</i> and <i>an</i>, which were added to verbal bases just like
<i>man</i>. By the side of <em>dâman</em>, the act of giving, we find in
the Veda
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
<a name = "page34" id = "page34"> </a>
<em>dâ-van</em>, the act of giving, and a dative <em>dâ-váne</em>, with
the accent on the suffix, meaning for the giving, <i>i.e.</i> to give.
Now in Greek this <i>v</i> would necessarily disappear, though its
former presence might be indicated by the <i>digamma æolicum</i>. Thus,
instead of Sanskrit <em>dâváne</em>, we should have in Greek <span class
= "greek" title = "dowenai, doenai">δοϝέναι, δοέναι</span>, and
contracted <span class = "greek" title = "dounai">δοῦναι</span>, the
regular form of the infinitive of the aorist, a&nbsp;form in which the
diphthong <span class = "greek" title = "ou">ου</span> would remain
inexplicable, except for the former presence of the lost syllable <span
class = "greek" title = "we">ϝε</span>. In the same manner <span class =
"greek" title = "einai">εἶναι</span> stands for <span class = "greek"
title = "es-wenai, es-enai, eenai, einai">ἐσ-ϝέναι, ἐσ-έναι, ἐέναι,
εἶναι</span>. Hence <span class = "greek" title = "ienai">ἰέναι</span>,
stands for <span class = "greek" title = "iwenai">ἰϝέναι</span>, and
even the accent remains on the suffix <i>van</i>, just as it did in
Sanskrit.</p>

<p>As the infinitives in <span class = "greek" title =
"menai">μεναι</span> were traced back to the suffix <i>man</i>, and
those in <span class = "greek" title = "wenai">ϝεναι</span> to a suffix
<i>van</i>, the regular infinitives in <span class = "greek" title =
"enai">εναι</span> after consonants, and <span class = "greek" title =
"nai">ναι</span> after vowels, must be referred to the suffix <i>an</i>,
dat. <i>ane</i>. Here, too, we find analogous forms in the Veda. From
<em>dhûrv</em>, to hurt, we have <em class = "sanskrit">dhû́rv-aṇe</em>,
for the purpose of hurting, in order to hurt; in Rv. IX. 61, 30, we find
<em>vibhv-áne</em>, Rv. VI. 61, 13, in order to conquer, and by the same
suffix the Greeks formed their infinitives of the perfect, <span class =
"greek" title = "leloip-enai">λελοιπ-έναι</span>, and the infinitives of
the verbs in <span class = "greek" title = "mi">μι</span>, <span class =
"greek" title = "tithe-nai, dido-nai, hista-nai">τιθέ-ναι, διδο-ναι,
ἱστα-ναι</span>, etc.</p>

<p>In order to explain, after these antecedents, the origin of the
infinitive in <span class = "greek" title = "ein">ειν</span>, as <span
class = "greek" title = "tuptein">τύπτειν</span>, we must admit either
the shortening of <span class = "greek" title = "nai">ναι</span> to
<span class = "greek" title = "ni">νι</span>, which is difficult; or the
existence of a locative in ι by the side of a dative in <span class =
"greek" title = "ai">αι</span>. That the locative can take the place of
the dative we see clearly in the Sanskrit forms of the aorist, <em class
= "sanskrit">parsháṇi</em>, to cross, <em class =
"sanskrit">nesháṇi</em>, to lead, which, as far as their form, not their
origin, is concerned, would well match Greek forms like
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<a name = "page35" id = "page35"> </a>
<span class = "greek" title = "lusein">λύσειν</span> in the future. In
either case, <span class = "greek" title = "tupte-ni">τύπτε-νι</span> in
Greek would have become <span class = "greek" title =
"tuptein">τύπτειν</span>, just as <span class = "greek" title =
"tupte-si">τύπτε-σι</span> became <span class = "greek" title =
"tupteis">τύπτεις</span>. In the Doric dialect this throwing back of the
final ι is omitted in the second person singular, where the Dorians may
say <span class = "greek" title = "amelges">ἀμέλγες</span> for <span
class = "greek" title = "amelgeis">ἀμέλγεις</span>; and in the same
Doric dialect the infinitive, too, occurs in <span class = "greek" title
= "en">εν</span> instead of <span class = "greek" title =
"ein">ειν</span>; <i>e.g.</i>, <span class = "greek" title =
"aeiden">ἀείδεν</span> instead of <span class = "greek" title =
"aeidein">ἀείδειν</span>. (Buttman, “Greek Gr.,” §&nbsp;103,
10,&nbsp;11.)</p>

<p>In this manner the growth of grammatical forms can be made as clear
as the sequence of any historical events in the history of the world,
nay, I&nbsp;should say far clearer, far more intelligible; and I should
think that even the first learning of these grammatical forms might be
somewhat seasoned and rendered more really instructive by allowing the
pupil, from time to time, a&nbsp;glimpse into the past history of the
Greek and Latin languages. In English what we call the infinitive is
clearly a dative; <i>to speak</i> shows by its very preposition what it
was intended for. How easy, then, to explain to a beginner that if he
translates, “able to speak,” by <span class = "greek" title = "hikanos eipein">ἱκανὸς εἰπεῖν</span>, the Greek infinitive is really the same as
the English, and that <span class = "greek" title =
"eipein">εἰπεῖν</span> stands for <span class = "greek" title =
"eipeni">εἴπενι</span> and this for <span class = "greek" title =
"eipenai">εἴπεναι</span>, which, to a certain extent, answers the same
purpose as the Greek <span class = "greek" title = "epei">ἔπει</span>,
the dative of <span class = "greek" title = "epos">ἔπος</span>, and
therefore originally <span class = "greek" title =
"epesi">ἔπεσι</span>.</p>

<p>And remark, these very datives and locatives of nouns formed by the
suffix <span class = "greek" title = "os">ος</span> in Greek, as in
Sanskrit, <i>es</i> in Latin, though they yield no infinitives in Greek,
yield the most common form of the infinitive in Latin, and may be traced
also in Sanskrit. As from <i>genus</i> we form a dative <i>generi</i>,
and a locative <i>genere</i>, which stands for <i>genese</i>, so from
<i>gigno</i> an abstract noun would be formed, <i>gignus</i>, and from
it a dative,
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<a name = "page36" id = "page36"> </a>
<i>gigneri</i>, and a locative, <i>gignere</i>. I do not say that the
intermediate form <i>gignus</i> existed in the spoken Latin, I&nbsp;only
maintain that such a form would be analogous to <i>gen-us</i>,
<i>op-us</i>, <i>fœd-us</i>, and that in Sanskrit the process is exactly
the same. We form in Sanskrit a substantive <em>càkshas</em>, sight,
<em>càkshus</em>, eye; and we find the dative of <em>càkshas</em>,
<i>i.e.</i> <em>càkshase</em>, used as what we should call an
infinitive, in order to see. But we also find another so-called
infinitive, <em>jîvàse</em>, in order to live, although there is no
noun, <em>jîvas</em>, life; we find <em>áyase</em>, to go, although
there is no noun <em>áyas</em>, going. This Sanskrit <em>áyase</em>
explains the Latin <i>i-re</i>, as *<em>i-vane</em> explained the Greek
<span class = "greek" title = "ienai">ἰέναι</span>. The intention of the
old framers of language is throughout the same. They differ only in the
means which they use, one might almost say, at random; and the
differences between Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin are often due to the
simple fact that out of many possible forms that might be used and had
been used before the Aryan languages became traditional, settled, and
national, one family or clan or nation fancied one, another another.
While this one became fixed and classical, all others became useless,
remained perhaps here and there in proverbial sayings or in sacred
songs, but were given up at last completely, as strange, obsolete, and
unintelligible.</p>

<p>And even then, after a grammatical form has become obsolete and
unintelligible, it by no means loses its power of further development.
Though the Greeks did not themselves, we still imagine that we feel the
infinitive as the case of an abstract noun in many constructions. Thus
<span class = "greek" title = "chalepon heurein">χαλεπὸν εὑρεῖν</span>,
difficult to find, was originally, difficult in the finding, or
difficult
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<a name = "page37" id = "page37"> </a>
for the act of finding; <span class = "greek" title = "deinos legein">δεινὸς λέγειν</span>, meant literally, powerful in speaking;
<span class = "greek" title = "archomai legein">ἄρχομαι λέγειν</span>,
I&nbsp;begin to speak, <i>i.e.</i>, I direct myself to the act of
speaking; <span class = "greek" title = "keleai me muthêsasthai">κέλεαί
με μυθήσασθαι</span>, you bid me to speak, <i>i.e.</i>, you order me
towards the act of speaking; <span class = "greek" title = "phoboumai dielenchein se"><ins class = "correction" title = "text reads φόβοῦμαι with extra accent">φοβοῦμαι</ins> διελέγχειν σε</span>, I&nbsp;am afraid
of refuting you, <i>i.e.</i>, I fear in the act, or, I&nbsp;shrink when
brought towards the act, of refuting you; <span class = "greek" title =
"son ergon legein">σὸν ἔργον λέγειν</span>, your business is in or
towards speaking, you have to speak; <span class = "greek" title =
"pasin hadein chalepon">πᾶσιν ἁδεῖν χαλεπόν</span>, there is something
difficult in pleasing everybody, or, in our endeavor after pleasing
everybody. In all these cases the so-called infinitive can, with an
effort, still be felt as a noun in an oblique case. But in course of
time expressions such as <span class = "greek" title = "chalepon hadein">χαλεπὸν ἁδεῖν</span>, it is difficult to please, <span class =
"greek" title = "agathon legein">ἀγαθὸν λέγειν</span>, it is good to
speak, left in the mind of the speaker the impression that <span class =
"greek" title = "hadein">ἁδεῖν</span> and <span class = "greek" title =
"legein">λέγειν</span> were subjects in the nominative, the pleasing is
difficult, the speaking is good; and by adding the article, these
oblique cases of verbal nouns actually became nominatives, <span class =
"greek" title = "to hadein">τὸ ἁδειν</span>, the act of pleasing, <span
class = "greek" title = "to legein">τὸ λέγειν</span>, the act of
speaking, capable of being used in every case, <i>e.g.</i>, <span class
= "greek" title = "epithumia tou piein">ἐπιθυμια τοῦ πίειν</span>,
<i>desiderium bibendi</i>. This regeneration, this process of creating
new words out of decaying and decayed materials may seem at first sight
incredible, yet it is as certain as the change with which we began our
discussion of the infinitive. I&nbsp;mean the change of the conception
of a <span class = "greek" title = "rhêma genikôtaton">ῥῆμα
γενικώτατον</span>, a&nbsp;<i>verbum generalissimum</i>, into a
<i>generalissimus</i> or <i>infinitivus</i>. Nor is the process without
analogy in modern languages. The French <i>l’avenir</i>, the future
(<i>Zukunft</i>), is hardly the Latin <i>advenire</i>. That would mean
the arriving, the coming, but not what is to come. I&nbsp;believe
<i>l’avenir</i> was (<i>quod est</i>) <i>ad venire</i>, what is to come,
contracted
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
<a name = "page38" id = "page38"> </a>
to <i>l’avenir</i>. In Low-German <i>to come</i> assumes even the
character of an adjective, and we can speak not only of a year to come,
but of a to-come year, <i>de tokum Jahr</i>.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagI_23" id = "tagI_23" href = "#noteI_23">23</a></p>

<p>This process of grammatical vivisection may be painful in the eyes of
classical scholars, yet even they must see how great a difference there
is in the quality of knowledge imparted by our Greek and Latin grammars,
and by comparative grammar. I&nbsp;do not deny that at first children
must learn Greek and Latin mechanically, but it is not right that they
should remain satisfied with mere paradigms and technical terms, without
knowing the real nature and origin of so-called infinitives, gerunds,
and supines. Every child will learn the construction of the accusative
with the infinitive, but I well remember my utter amazement when I first
was taught to say <i>Miror te ad me nihil scribere</i>, “I am surprised
that you write nothing to me.” How easy would it have been to explain
that <i>scribere</i> was originally a locative of a verbal noun, and
that there was nothing strange or irrational in saying, “I&nbsp;wonder
at thee in the act of not writing to me.” This first step once taken,
everything else followed by slow degrees, but even in phrases like
<i>Spero te mihi ignoscere</i>, we can still see the first steps which
led from “I&nbsp;hope or I desire thee, toward the act of forgiving me,”
to “I&nbsp;trust thee to forgive me.” It is the object of the
comparative philologist to gather up the scattered fragments, to arrange
them and fit them, and thus to show that language is something rational,
human, intelligible, the very embodiment of the mind of man in its
growth from the lowest to the highest stage, and with capabilities for
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page39" id = "page39"> </a>
further growth far beyond what we can at present conceive or
imagine.</p>

<p>As to writing Greek and Latin verse, I do not maintain that a
knowledge of Comparative Philology will help us much. It is simply an
art that must be acquired by practice, if in these our busy days it is
still worth acquiring. A&nbsp;good memory will no doubt enable us to say
at a moment’s notice whether certain syllables are long or short. But is
it not far more interesting to know why certain vowels are long and
others short, than to be able to string longs and shorts together in
imitation of Greek and Latin hexameters? Now in many cases the reason
why certain vowels are long or short, can be supplied by Comparative
Philology alone. We may learn from Latin grammar that the <i>i</i> in
<i>fîdus</i>, trusty, and in <i>fîdo</i>, I trust, is long, and that it
is short in <i>fides</i>, trust, and <i>perfidus</i>, faithless; but as
all these words are derived from the same root, why should some have a
long, others a short vowel? A&nbsp;comparison of Sanskrit at once
supplies an answer. Certain derivatives, not only in Latin but in
Sanskrit and Greek too, require what is called <em class =
"sanskrit">Guṇa</em> of the radical vowel. In <i>fîdus</i> and
<i>fîdo</i>, the <i>i</i> is really a diphthong, and represents a more
ancient <i>ei</i> or <i>oi</i>, the former appearing in Greek <span
class = "greek" title = "peithô">πείθω</span>, the latter in Latin
<i>foedus</i>, a truce.</p>

<p>We learn from our Greek grammars that the second syllable in <span
class = "greek" title = "deiknūmi">δείκνῡμι</span> is long, but in the
plural, <span class = "greek" title = "deiknŭmen">δείκνῠμεν</span>, it
is short. This cannot be by accident, and we may observe the same change
in <span class = "greek" title = "damnêmi">δάμνημι</span> and <span
class = "greek" title = "damnamen">δάμναμεν</span>, and similar words.
Nothing, however, but a study of Sanskrit would have enabled us to
discover the reason of this change, which is really the accent
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
<a name = "page40" id = "page40"> </a>
in its most primitive working, such as we can watch it in the Vedic
Sanskrit, where it produces exactly the same change, only with far
greater regularity and perspicuity.</p>

<p>Why, again, do we say in Greek, <span class = "greek" title =
"oida">οἶδα</span>, I know, but <span class = "greek" title =
"is-men">ἴσ-μεν</span>, we know? Why <span class = "greek" title =
"tetlêka">τέτληκα</span>, but <span class = "greek" title =
"tetlamen">τέτλαμεν</span>? Why <span class = "greek" title =
"memona">μέμονα</span>, but <span class = "greek" title =
"memamen">μέμαμεν</span>? There is no recollection in the minds of the
Greeks of the motive power that was once at work, and left its traces in
these grammatical convulsions; but in Sanskrit we still see, as it were,
a&nbsp;lower stratum of grammatical growth, and we can there watch the
regular working of laws which required these changes, and which have
left their impress not only on Greek, but on Sanskrit, and even on
German. The same necessity which made Homer say <span class = "greek"
title = "oida">οἶδα</span> and <span class = "greek" title =
"idmen">ἴδμεν</span>, and the Vedic poet <em>véda</em> and
<em>vidmás</em>, still holds good, and makes us say in German, <i>Ich
weiss</i>, I know, but <i>wir wissen</i>, we know.</p>

<p>All this becomes clear and intelligible by the light of Comparative
Grammar; anomalies vanish, exceptions prove the rule, and we perceive
more plainly every day how in language, as elsewhere, the conflict
between the freedom claimed by each individual and the resistance
offered by the community at large, establishes in the end a reign of law
most wonderful, yet perfectly rational and intelligible.</p>

<p>These are but a few small specimens to show you what Comparative
Philology can do for Greek and Latin; and how it has given a new life to
the study of languages by discovering, so to say, and laying bare, the
traces of that old life, that prehistoric growth, which made language
what we find it in the oldest literary monuments, and which still
supplies the vigor of the language of our own time. A
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<a name = "page41" id = "page41"> </a>
knowledge of the mere facts of language is interesting enough; nay, if
you ask yourself what grammars really are&mdash;those very Greek and
Latin grammars which we hated so much in our schoolboy days&mdash;you
will find that they are store-houses, richer than the richest museums of
plants or minerals, more carefully classified and labeled than the
productions of any of the great kingdoms of nature. Every form of
declension and conjugation, every genitive and every so-called
infinitive and gerund, is the result of a long succession of efforts,
and of intelligent efforts. There is nothing accidental, nothing
irregular, nothing without a purpose and meaning in any part of Greek or
Latin grammar. No one who has once discovered this hidden life of
language, no one who has once found out that what seemed to be merely
anomalous and whimsical in language is but, as it were,
a&nbsp;petrification of thought, of deep, curious, poetical,
philosophical thought, will ever rest again till he has descended as far
as he can descend into the ancient shafts of human speech, exploring
level after level, and testing every successive foundation which
supports the surface of each spoken language.</p>

<p>One of the great charms of this new science is that there is still so
much to explore, so much to sift, so much to arrange. I&nbsp;shall not,
therefore, be satisfied with merely lecturing on Comparative Philology,
but I hope I shall be able to form a small philological society of more
advanced students, who will come and work with me, and bring the results
of their special studies as materials for the advancement of our
science. If there are scholars here who have devoted their attention to
the study of Homer, Comparative Philology will place in their hands a
light
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<a name = "page42" id = "page42"> </a>
with which to explore the dark crypt on which the temple of the Homeric
language was erected. If there are scholars who know their Plautus or
Lucretius, Comparative Philology will give them a key to grammatical
forms in ancient Latin, which, even if supported by an Ambrosian
palimpsest, might still seem hazardous and problematical. As there is no
field and no garden that has not its geological antecedents, there is no
language and no dialect which does not receive light from a study of
Comparative Philology, and reflect light in return on more general
problems. As in geology again, so in Comparative Philology, no progress
is possible without a division of labor, and without the most general
coöperation. The most experienced geologist may learn something from a
miner or from a ploughboy; the most experienced comparative philologist
may learn something from a schoolboy or from a child.</p>

<p>I have thus explained to you what, if you will but assist me,
I&nbsp;should like to do as the first occupant of this new chair of
Comparative Philology. In my public lectures I must be satisfied with
teaching. In my private lectures, I&nbsp;hope I shall not only teach,
but also learn, and receive back as much as I have to give.</p>

<div class = "notes">

<p><span class = "firstword">One</span> or two instances may here
suffice to show how compassless even the best comparative philologists
find themselves if, without a knowledge of Sanskrit, they venture into
the deep waters of grammatical research. What can be clearer at first
sight than that the demonstrative pronoun <i>that</i> has the same base
in Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and German? Bopp places together (§&nbsp;349)
the following forms of the <span class =

<td><i>is-tud</i></td>
<td><i>thata</i></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>and he draws from them the following conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Sanskrit <em>ta-t</em> we have the same pronominal element
repeated twice, and this repeated pronominal element became afterwards
the general sign of the neuter after other pronominal stems, such as
<em>ya-t</em>, <em>ka-t</em>.</p>

<p>Such a conclusion seems extremely probable, particularly when we
compare the masculine form <em>sa-s</em>, the old nom. sing., instead of
the ordinary <em>sa</em>. But the first question that has to be answered
is, whether this is phonetically possible, and how.</p>

<p>If <em>tat</em> in Sanskrit is <em>ta</em> + <em>ta</em>, then we
expect in Gothic <i>tha</i> + <i>tha</i>, instead of which we find
<i>tha</i> + <i>ta</i>. We expect in Latin <i>istut</i>, not
<i>istud</i>, <i>illut</i>, not <i>illud</i>, <i>it</i>, not <i>id</i>,
for Latin represents final <i>t</i> in Sanskrit by <i>t</i>, not by
<i>d</i>. The old Latin ablative in <i>d</i> is not a case in point, as
we shall see afterwards.</p>

<p>Both Gothic <i>tha-ta</i>, therefore, and Latin <i>istud</i>,
postulate a Sanskrit <em>tad</em>, while Zend and Greek at all events do
not conflict with an original final media. Everything therefore depends
on what was the original form in Sanskrit; and here no Sanskrit scholar
would hesitate for one moment between <em>tat</em> and <em>tad</em>.
Whatever the origin of <em>tat</em> may have been, it is quite
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page44" id = "page44"> </a>
certain that Sanskrit knows only of <em>tad</em>, never of <em>tat</em>.
There are various ways of testing the original surd or sonant nature of
final consonants in Sanskrit. One of the safest seems to me to see how
those consonants behave before <em>taddhita</em> or secondary suffixes,
which require no change in the final consonant of the base. Thus before
the suffix <em>îya</em> (called <em>cha</em> by <span class =
"sanskrit">Pâṇini</span>) the final consonant is never changed, yet we
find <em>tad-îya</em>, like <em>mad-îya</em>, <em>tvad-îya</em>,
<em>asmad-îya</em>, <em>yushmad-îya</em>, etc. Again, before the
possessive suffix <em>vat</em> final consonants of nominal bases suffer
no change. This is distinctly stated by <span class =
"sanskrit">Pâṇini</span>, I.&nbsp;4, 19. Hence we have
<em>vidyut-vân</em>, from <em>vidyut</em>, lightning, from the root
<em>dyut</em>; we have <em>udaśvit-vân</em>, from <em>uda-śvi-t</em>. In
both cases the original final tenuis remains unchanged. Hence, if we
find <em>tad-vân</em>, <em>kad-vân</em>, our test shows us again that
the final consonant in <em>tad</em> and <em>kad</em> is a media, and
that the <i>d</i> of these words is not a modification of <i>t</i>.</p>

<p>Taking our stand therefore on the undoubted facts of Sanskrit
grammar, we cannot recognize <i>t</i> as the termination of the neuter
of pronominal stems, but only <i>d</i>;<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_24"
id = "tagI_24" href = "#noteI_24">24</a> nor can we accept Bopp’s
explanation of <em>tad</em> as a compound of <em>ta</em> + t, unless the
transition of an original <i>t</i> into a Sanskrit and Latin <i>d</i>
can be established by sufficient evidence. Even then that transition
would have to be referred to a time before Sanskrit and Gothic became
distinct languages, for the Gothic <i>tha-ta</i> is the counterpart of
the Sanskrit <em>tad</em>, and not of <em>tat</em>.</p>

<p>Bopp endeavors to defend the transition of an original <i>t</i> into
Latin <i>d</i> by the termination of the old ablatives, such as
<i>gnaivod</i>, etc. But here again it is certain that the original
termination was <i>d</i>, and not <i>t</i>. It is so in Latin, it may be
so in Zend, where, as Justi points out, the <i>d</i> of the ablative is
probably a media.<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_25" id = "tagI_25" href =
"#noteI_25">25</a> In Sanskrit it is certainly a media in such forms as
<em>mad</em>, <em>tvad</em>, <em>asmad</em>, which Bopp considers as old
ablatives, and which in <em>madîya</em>, etc., show the original media.
In other cases it is impossible in Sanskrit to test the nature of the
final dental in
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page45" id = "page45"> </a>
the ablative, because <i>d</i> is always determined by its position in a
sentence. But under no circumstances could we appeal to Latin
<i>gnaivod</i> in order to prove a transition of an original <i>t</i>
into <i>d</i>; while on the contrary all the evidence at present is in
favor of a media, as the final letter both of the ablative and of the
neuter bases of pronouns, such as <em>tad</em> and <em>yad</em>.</p>

<p>These may seem <i>minutiæ</i>, but the whole of Comparative Grammar
is made up of <i>minutiæ</i>, which, nevertheless, if carefully joined
together and cemented, lead to conclusions of unexpected magnitude.</p>

<div class = "notes">

<p><span class = "firstword">I add</span> one other instance to show how
a more accurate knowledge of Sanskrit would have guarded comparative
philologists against rash conclusions. With regard to the nominative
singular of feminine bases ending in derivative <i>â</i>, the question
arose, whether words like <i>bona</i> in Latin, <span class = "greek"
title = "agatha">ἀγαθά</span> in Greek, <em>sivâ</em> in Sanskrit, had
originally an <i>s</i> as the sign of the nom. sing., which was
afterwards lost, or whether they never took that termination. Bopp
(§&nbsp;136), Schleicher (§&nbsp;246), and others seem to believe in the
loss of the <i>s</i>, chiefly, it would seem, because the <i>s</i> is
added to feminine bases ending in <i>î</i> and <i>û</i>. Benfey<a class
= "tag" name = "tagI_26" id = "tagI_26" href = "#noteI_26">26</a> takes
the opposite view, viz. that feminines in <i>â</i> never took the
<i>s</i> of the nom. sing. But he adds one exception, the Vedic
<em>gnâ-s</em>. This remark has caused much mischief. Without verifying
Benfey’s statements, Schleicher (l.c.) quotes the same exception, though
cautiously referring to the Sanskrit dictionary of Boehtlingk and Roth
as his authority. Later writers, for instance Merguet,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagI_27" id = "tagI_27" href = "#noteI_27">27</a> leave out all
restrictions, simply appealing to this Vedic form <em>gnâ-s</em> in
support of the theory that feminine bases in <i>â</i> too took
originally <i>s</i> as sign of the nom. sing. and afterwards dropped it.
Even so careful a scholar as Büchler<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_28" id

lost.</p>

have been added<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_29" id = "tagI_29" href =
"#noteI_29">29</a>; secondly, there is none why it should have been
lost. But, whatever opinion we may hold in this respect, the appeal to
the Vedic <em>gnâ-s</em> cannot certainly be sustained, and the word
should at all events be obelized till there is better evidence for it
than we possess at present.<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_30" id =

<p>The passage which is always quoted from the Rv. IV. 9, 4, as showing
<em>gnâ-s</em> to be a nom. sing. in <i>s</i>, is extremely difficult,
and as it stands at present, most likely <span class =

<p class = "sanskrit">Utá gnấḥ agníḥ adhvaré utó gṛhá-patiḥ dáme, utá

<p>This could only be translated:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Agni sits down at the sacrifice as a woman, as lord in the house,
and as priest.”</p>

<p>This, however, is impossible, for Agni, the god of fire, is never
represented in the Veda as a woman. If we took <em class =
"sanskrit">gnâḥ</em> as a genitive, we might translate, “Agni sits down
in the sacrifice of the lady of the house,” but this again would be
utterly incongruous in Vedic poetry.</p>

<p>I believe the verse is corrupt, and I should propose to
read:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "sanskrit">Utá agnấv agníḥ adhvaré.</p>

<p>“Agni sits down at the sacrifice in the fire, as lord in the house,
and as a priest.”</p>

<p>The ideas that Agni, the god of fire, sits down in the fire, or that
Agni is lighted by Agni, or that Agni is both the sacrificial fire and
the priest, are familiar to every reader of the Veda. Thus we read,
I.&nbsp;12, 6, <span class = "sanskrit">agnínâ agníḥ sám idhyate</span>,
“Agni is lighted by Agni;” X. 88, 1, we find Agni invoked as ấ-hutam
agnáu, etc.</p>

how unsafe it would be to support the theory that feminine bases in

<p><span class = "firstword">There</span> is no trace of such a term as
infinitive in Sanskrit, and yet exactly the same forms, or, at all
events, forms strictly analogous to those which we call infinitives in
Greek and Latin, exist in Sanskrit. Here, however, they are treated in
the simplest way.</p>

<p>Sanskrit grammarians when giving the rules according to which nouns
and adjectives are derived from verbal roots by means of primary
suffixes (<span class = "sanskrit">Kṛt</span>), mention among the rest
the suffixes <em>tum</em> (<span class = "sanskrit">Pâṇ.</span>, III.
3,&nbsp;10), <em>se</em>, <em>ase</em>, <em>adhyai</em>, <em>tavai</em>,
<em>tave</em>, <em>shyai</em>, e, <em>am</em>, <em>tos</em>, <em>as</em>
(IV.&nbsp;4, 9&ndash;17), defining their meaning
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page48" id = "page48"> </a>
in general by that of <em>tum</em> (III. 3,&nbsp;10). This <em>tum</em>
is said to express immediate futurity in a verb, if governed by another
word conveying an intention. An example will make this clearer. In order
to say he goes to cook, where “he goes” expresses an intention, and “to
cook” is the object of that intention which is to follow immediately, we
place the suffix <em>tum</em> at the end of the verb <em>pak</em>, to
cook, and say in Sanskrit, vrajati pak-tum. We might also say pâcako
vrajati, he goes as one who means to cook, or vrajati pâkâya, he goes to
the act of cooking, placing the abstract noun in the dative; and all
these constructions are mentioned together by Sanskrit grammarians. The
same takes place after verbs which express a wish (III. 3, 158);
<i>e.g.</i>, icchati paktum, he wishes to cook, and after such words as
<em>kâla</em>, time, <em>samaya</em>, opportunity, <em>velâ</em>, right
moment (III. 3, 167); <i>e.g.</i>, <span class = "sanskrit">kâlaḥ
paktum</span>, it is time to cook, etc. Other verbs which govern forms
in <em>tum</em> are (III. 4,&nbsp;65) <em>śak</em>, to be able; <em
class = "sanskrit">dhṛsh</em>, to dare; <em>jñâ</em>, to know;
<em>glai</em>, to be weary; <em class = "sanskrit">ghaṭ</em>, to
endeavor; <em>ârabh</em>, to begin; <em>labh</em>, to get;
<em>prakram</em>, to begin; <em>utsah</em>, to endure; <em>arh</em>, to
deserve; and words like <em>asti</em>, there is; <i>e.g.</i>, asti
bhoktum, it is (possible) to eat; not, it is (necessary) to eat. The
forms in <em>tum</em> are also enjoined (III. 4,&nbsp;66) after words
like <em>alam</em>, expressing fitness, <i>e.g.</i>, paryâpto bhoktum,
alam bhoktum, kuśalo bhoktum, fit or able to eat.</p>

<p>Here we have everything that is given by Sanskrit grammarians in
place of what we should call the Chapter on the Infinitive in Greek and
Latin. The only thing that has to be added is the provision, understood
in <span class = "sanskrit">Pâṇini’s</span> grammar, that such suffixes
as <em>tum</em>, etc., are indeclinable.</p>

<p>And why are they indeclinable? For the simple reason that they are
themselves case terminations. Whether <span class =
"sanskrit">Pâṇini</span> was aware of this, we cannot tell with
certainty. From some of his remarks it would seem to be so. When
treating of the cases, <span class = "sanskrit">Pâṇini</span>
(I.&nbsp;4,&nbsp;32) explains what we should call the dative by
<em>Sampradâna</em>. <em>Sampradâna</em> means giving (<span class =
"greek" title = "dotikê">δοτική</span>), but <span class =
"sanskrit">Pâṇini</span> uses it here as a technical term, and assigns
to it the definite meaning of “he whom one looks to by any act” (not
only the act of giving, as the commentators imply). It is therefore what
we should call “the remote object.” Ex. <span class =
"sanskrit">Brâhmaṇâya dhanam dadâti</span>, he gives wealth to the
Brâhman. This is afterwards extended by several rules explaining that
the
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<a name = "page49" id = "page49"> </a>
<em>Sampradâna</em> comes in after verbs expressive of pleasure caused
to somebody (I.&nbsp;4,&nbsp;33); after <em>ślâgh</em>, to applaud,
<em>hnu</em>, to dissemble, to conceal, <em>sthâ</em>,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagI_31" id = "tagI_31" href = "#noteI_31">31</a> to reveal,
<em>śap</em>, to curse (I.&nbsp;4,&nbsp;34); after <em>dhâray</em>, to
owe (I.&nbsp;4,&nbsp;35); <em class = "sanskrit">spṛh</em>, to long for
(I.&nbsp;4,&nbsp;36); after verbs expressive of anger, ill-will, envy,
detraction (I.&nbsp;4,&nbsp;37); after <em>râdh</em> and <em>îksh</em>,
if they mean to consider concerning a person (I.&nbsp;4,&nbsp;39); after
<em>pratiśru</em> and <em>âśru</em>, in the sense of according
(I.&nbsp;4,&nbsp;40); <em class = "sanskrit">anugṛ</em> and <em class =
"sanskrit">pratigṛ</em>, in the sense of acting in accordance with
(I.&nbsp;4,&nbsp;41); after <em>parikrî</em>, to buy, to hire
(I.&nbsp;4,&nbsp;44). Other cases of <em>Sampradâna</em> are mentioned
after such words as <em class = "sanskrit">namaḥ</em>, salutation to,
<em>svasti</em>, hail, <em>svâhâ</em>, salutation to the gods,
<em>svadhâ</em>, salutation to the manes, <em>alam</em>, sufficient for,
<em class = "sanskrit">vashaṭ</em>, offered to, a&nbsp;sacrificial
invocation, etc. (II.&nbsp;3,&nbsp;16); and in such expressions as <span
class = "sanskrit">na tvam triṇâya manye</span>, I&nbsp;do not value
thee a straw (II.&nbsp;3,&nbsp;17); grâmâya gacchati, he goes to the
village (II.&nbsp;2,&nbsp;12): where, however, the accusative, too, is
equally admissible. Some other cases of Sampradâna are mentioned in the
Vârttikas; <i>e.g.</i>, I.&nbsp;4, 44, muktaye harim bhajati, for the
sake of liberation he worships Hari; vâtâya kapilâ vidyut, a&nbsp;dark
red lightning indicates wind. Very interesting, too, is the construction
with the prohibitive <em>mâ</em>; <i>e.g.</i> mâ câpalâya, lit. not for
unsteadiness, <i>i.e.</i>, do not act unsteadily.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagI_32" id = "tagI_32" href = "#noteI_32">32</a></p>

<p>In all these cases we easily recognize the identity of
<em>Sampradâna</em> with the dative in Greek and Latin. If therefore we
see that <span class = "sanskrit">Pâṇini</span> in some of his rules
states that <em>Sampradâna</em> takes the place of <em>tum</em>, the so
called infinitive, we can hardly doubt that he had perceived the
similarity in the functions of what we call dative and infinitive. Thus
he says that instead of <span class = "sanskrit">phalâny âhartum
yâti</span>, he goes to take the fruits, we may use the dative and say
<span class = "sanskrit">phalebhyo yâti</span>, he goes for the fruits;
instead of <span class = "sanskrit">yashṭum yâti</span>, he goes to
sacrifice, <span class = "sanskrit">yâgâya yâti</span>, he goes to the
act of sacrificing (II.&nbsp;3, 14&ndash;15).</p>

<p>But whether <span class = "sanskrit">Pâṇini</span> recognized this
fact or not, certain it is that we have only to look at the forms which
in the Veda take the place of <em>tum</em>, in order to convince
ourselves that most of
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<a name = "page50" id = "page50"> </a>
them are datives of verbal nouns. As far as Sanskrit grammar is
concerned, we may safely cancel the name of infinitive altogether, and
speak instead boldly of datives and other cases of verbal nouns. Whether
these verbal nouns admit of the dative case only, and whether some of
those datival terminations have become obsolete, are questions which do
not concern the grammarian, and nothing would be more unphilosophical
than to make such points the specific characteristic of a new
grammatical category, the infinitive. The very idea that every noun must
possess a complete set of cases, is contrary to all the lessons of the
history of language; and though the fact that some of these forms belong
to an antiquated phase of language has undoubtedly contributed towards
their being used more readily for certain syntactical purposes, the fact
remains that in their origin and their original intention they were
datives and nothing else. Neither could the fact that these datives of
verbal nouns may govern the same case which is governed by the verb, be
used as a specific mark, because it is well known that, in Sanskrit more
particularly, many nouns retain the power of governing the accusative.
We shall now examine some of these so-called infinitives in
Sanskrit.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Datives in <i>e</i>.</h6>

<p>The simplest dative is that in <i>e</i>, after verbal bases ending in
consonants or <i>â</i>, e.g., <em class = "sanskrit">dṛśé</em>, for the
sake of seeing, to see; <em>vid-é</em>, to know, <em>paribhveê</em>,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagI_33" id = "tagI_33" href = "#noteI_33">33</a>
to overcome; <em>śraddhé kám</em>, to believe.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Datives in <i>ai</i>.</h6>

<p>After some verbs ending in <i>â</i>, the dative is irregularly
(Grammar, §§&nbsp;239, 240) formed in <i>ai</i>; Rv. VII. 19, 7,
<em>parâdái</em>, to surrender. III. 60, 4, <em>pratimái</em>, to
compare, and the important form <em>vayodhái</em>, of which more by and
by.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Accusatives in <i>am</i>. Genitives and
Ablatives in <i>as</i>. Locatives in <i>i</i>.</h6>

<p>By the side of these datives we have analogous accusatives in
<i>am</i>, genitives and ablatives in <i>as</i>, locatives in
<i>i</i>.</p>

<p>Accusative: I. 73, 10, śakéma yámam, May we be able to get.
I.&nbsp;94, 3, śakéma tvâ samídhan, May we be able to light
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<a name = "page51" id = "page51"> </a>
thee. This may be the Oscan and Umbrian infinitive in <i>um</i>,
<i>om</i> (<i>u</i>, <i>o</i>), if we take <em>yama</em> as a base in
<i>a</i>, and <i>m</i> as the sign of the accusative. In Sanskrit it is
impossible to determine this question, for that bases in <i>a</i> also
are used for similar purposes is clearly seen in datives like
<em>dábhâya</em>; <i>e.g.</i>, Rv. V. 44, 2, ná dábhâya, not to conquer;
VIII. 96, 1, <span class = "sanskrit">nṛ́bhyâḥ tárâya síndhavaḥ
su-pârấḥ</span>, the rivers easy to cross for men. Whether the Vedic
imperatives in <em>âya</em> (<em>śâyac</em>) admit of a similar
explanation is doubtful on account of the accent.</p>

<p>Genitive: <em class = "sanskrit">vilikhaḥ</em>, in <span class =
"sanskrit">îśvaro <ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘vilik{h}a{h}’">vilikhaḥ</ins></span>, cognizant of drawing; and
possibly X.&nbsp;108,&nbsp;2, <span class = "sanskrit">atiskádaḥ
bhiyásâ</span>, from fear of crossing.</p>

<p>Ablative: Rv. VIII. 1, 12, <span class = "sanskrit">purâ
âtṛ́daḥ</span>, before striking.</p>

<p>Locative: Rv. V. 52, 12, <span class = "sanskrit">dṛśí tvishé</span>,
to shine in glancing(?)</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Datives in <i>s-e</i>.</h6>

<p>The same termination of the dative is added to verbal bases which
have taken the increment of the aorist, the&nbsp;s. Thus from
<em>ji</em>, to conquer, we have <em>ji-sh</em>, and <em>je-sh</em>, and
from both datival forms with infinitival function. I.&nbsp;111, 4, <span
class = "sanskrit">té naḥ hinvantu sâtáye dhiyé jishé</span>, May they
bring us to wealth, wisdom, victory!</p>

<p>I. 100, 11, apấm tokásya tánayasya jeshé, May Indra help us for
getting water, children, and descendants. Cf. VI. 44, 18.</p>

<p>Or, after bases ending in consonants, <em>upaprakshé</em>; V. 47, 6,
<span class = "sanskrit">upa-prakshé vṛ́shaṇaḥ -&nbsp;-&nbsp;- vadhvấḥ
yanti áccha</span>, the men go towards their wives to embrace.</p>

<p>These forms correspond to Greek infinitives like <span class =
"greek" title = "lusai">λῦσαι</span> and <span class = "greek" title =
"tupsai">τύψαι</span>, possibly to Latin infinitives like <i>ferre</i>,
for <i>fer-se</i>, <i>velle</i> for <i>vel-se</i>, and <i>voluis-se</i>;
for <i>se</i>, following immediately on a consonant, can never represent
the Sanskrit <em>ase</em>. With regard to infinitives like
<i>fac-se</i>, <i>dic-se</i>, I do not venture to decide whether they
are primitive forms, or contracted, though <i>fac-se</i> could hardly be
called a contraction of <i>fecisse</i>. The 2d pers. sing. of the
imperative of the 1st aorist middle, <span class = "greek" title =
"lusai">λῦσαι</span>, is identical with the infinitive in form, and the
transition of meaning from the infinitive to the imperative is well
known in Greek and other languages. (<span class = "greek" title =
"Paida d’ emoi lusai te philên ta t’ apoina dechesthai">Παῖδα δ’ ἐμοὶ
λῦσαί τε φίλην τά τ’ ἄποινα δέχεσθαι</span>, Deliver up my dear child
and accept the ransom). Several of these aoristic forms are sometimes
very perplexing in Sanskrit. If we find, for instance, <em>stushé</em>,
we cannot always tell whether
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<a name = "page52" id = "page52"> </a>
it is the infinitive (<span class = "greek" title =
"lusai">λῦσαι</span>); or the 1st pers. sing. of the aor. Âtmanep. in
the subjunctive (for <em>stushai</em>), Let me praise (<span class =
"greek" title = "lusômai">λύσωμαι</span>); or lastly, the 2d pers. sing.
Âtmanep. in the indicative (<span class = "greek" title =
"luêi">λύῃ</span>). If <em>stushe</em> has no accent, we know, of
course, that it cannot be the infinitive, as in X. 93, 9; but when it
has the accent on the last, it may, in certain constructions, be either
infinitive, or 1st pers. sing. aor. Âtm. subj. Here we want far more
careful grammatical studies on the language of the Veda, before we can
venture to translate with certainty. In places, for instance, where as
in I.&nbsp;122, 7&nbsp;we have a nominative with <em>stushé</em>, it is
clear that it must be taken as an infinitive, <span class =
"sanskrit">stushé sâ vâm -&nbsp;-&nbsp;- râtíḥ</span>, your gift, <span
class = "sanskrit">Varuṇa</span> and Mitra, is to be praised; but in
other places, such as VIII. 5, 4, the choice is difficult. In VIII. 65,
5, <span class = "sanskrit">índra griṇîshé u stushé</span>,
I&nbsp;should propose to translate, Indra, thou longest for praising,
thou desirest to be praised, cf. VIII. 71, 15; while in II. 20, 4, <span
class = "sanskrit">tám u stushe índram tám gṛṇîshe</span>,
I&nbsp;translate, Let me praise Indra, let me laud him, admitting here,
the irregular retention of <span class = "sanskrit">Vikaraṇa</span> in
the aorist, which can be defended by analogous forms such as <span class
= "sanskrit">gṛ́-ṇî-sh-áṇi, stṛ́-ṇî-sh-áṇi</span>, of which more
hereafter. However, all these translations, as every real scholar knows,
are, and can be tentative only. Nothing but a complete Vedic grammar,
such as we may soon expect from Professor Benfey, will give us safe
ground to stand on.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Datives in <i>âyai</i>.</h6>

<p>Feminine bases in <i>â</i> form their dative in <em>âyai</em>, and
thus we find <em>carâyai</em> used in the Veda, VII. 77, 1, as what we
should call an infinitive, in the sense of to go. No other cases of
<em>carâ</em> have as yet been met with. A&nbsp;similar form is
<em>jârâyai</em>, to praise, I.&nbsp;38, 13.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Datives in <i>aye</i>.</h6>

<p>We have next to consider bases in <i>i</i>, forming their dative in
<em>áye</em>. Here, whenever we are acquainted with the word in other
cases, we naturally take <i>aye</i> as a simple dative of a noun. Thus
in I.&nbsp;31, 8, we should translate <em>sanáye dhánânâm</em>, for the
acquisition of treasures, because we are accustomed to other cases, such
as I.&nbsp;100, 13, <em>sanáyas</em>, acquisitions, V. 27, 3,
<em>saním</em>, wealth. But if we find, V. 80, 5, <em class =
"sanskrit">dṛśáye naḥ asthât</em>, she stood to be seen by us, lit., for
our seeing, then we
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<a name = "page53" id = "page53"> </a>
prefer, though wrongly, to look upon such datives as infinitives, simply
because we have not met with other cases of <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘d{ri}si-s’"><em class =
"sanskrit">dṛśi-s</em></ins>.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Datives in <i>taye</i>.</h6>

<p>What applies to datives of nouns in <i>i</i>, applies with still
greater force to datives of nouns in <i>ti</i>. There is no reason why
in IX. 96, 4&nbsp;we should call <em>áhataye</em>, to be without hurt,
an infinitive, simply because no other case of <em>áhati-s</em> occurs
in the Rig-Veda; while <em>ájîtaye</em>, not to fail, in the same line,
is called a dative of <em>ájîti-s</em>, because it occurs again in the
accusative <em>ájîti-m</em>.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Datives in <i>tyai</i>.</h6>

<p>In <em>ityái</em>, to go, I. 113, 6; 124, 1, we have a dative of
<em>iti-s</em>, the act of going, of which the instrumental
<em>ityâ</em> occurs likewise, I.&nbsp;167, 5. This <em>tyâ</em>,
shortened to <em>tya</em>, became afterwards the regular termination of
the gerund of compound verbs in <em>tya</em> (Grammar §&nbsp;446), while
<em>ya</em> (§&nbsp;445) points to an original <em>ya</em> or
<em>yai</em>.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Datives in <i>as-e</i>.</h6>

<p>Next follow datives from bases in <em>as</em>, partly with accent on
the first syllable, like neuter nouns in <em>as</em>, partly with the
accent on <em>as</em>; partly with <span class = "sanskrit">Guṇa</span>,
partly without. With regard to them it becomes still clearer how
impossible it would be to distinguish between datives of abstract nouns,
and other grammatical forms, to be called infinitives. Thus Rv.
I.&nbsp;7, 3&nbsp;we read <em>dîrghâya cákshase</em>, Indra made the sun
rise for long glancing, <i>i.e.</i>, that it might glance far and wide.
It is quite true that no other cases of <em>cákshas</em>, seeing, occur,
on which ground modern grammarians would probably class it as an
infinitive; but the qualifying dative <em>dîrghâya</em>, clearly shows
that the poet felt <em>cákshase</em> as the dative of a noun, and did
not trouble himself, whether that noun was defective in other cases or
not.</p>

<p>These datives of verbal nouns in <em>as</em>, correspond exactly to
Latin infinitives in <i>ĕre</i>, like <i>vivere</i> (<em>jîváse</em>),
and explain likewise infinitives in <i>âre</i>, <i>êre</i>, and
<i>îre</i>, forms which cannot be separated. It has been thought that
the nearest approach to an infinitive is to be found in such forms as
<em>jîváse</em>, <em>bhiyáse</em>, to fear (V.&nbsp;29,&nbsp;4), because
in such cases the ordinary nominal form would be <em>bháyas-e</em>.
There is, however, the instrumental <em>bhiyása</em>, X.
108,&nbsp;2.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<a name = "page54" id = "page54"> </a>
<h6 class = "smallcaps">Datives in <i>mane</i>.</h6>

<p>Next follow datives from nouns in <em>man</em>, <em>van</em>, and
<em>an</em>. The suffix <em>man</em> is very common in Sanskrit, for
forming verbal nouns, such as <em>kar-man</em>, doing, deed, from
<em>kar</em>. <em>Van</em> is almost restricted to forming <i>nomina
agentis</i>, such as <em>druh-van</em>, hating; but we find also
substantives like <em>pat-van</em>, still used in the sense of flying.
<em>An</em> also is generally used like <em>van</em>, but we can see
traces of its employment to form <i>nomina actionis</i> in Greek <span
class = "greek" title = "agôn">ἀγών</span>, Lat. <i>turbo</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Datives of nouns in <em>man</em>, used with infinitival functions,
are very common in the Veda; <i>e.g.</i> I.&nbsp;164, 6, <span class =
"sanskrit">pṛccâmi vidmane</span>, I&nbsp;ask to know; VIII. 93, 8,
<span class = "sanskrit">dâmane kṛtáḥ</span>, made to give. We find also
the instrumental case <em>vidmánâ</em>, <i>e.g.</i>, VI. 14, 5, vidmánâ
urushyáti, he protects by his knowledge. These correspond to Homeric
infinitives, like <span class = "greek" title = "idmenai, domenai">ἴδμεναι, δόμεναι</span>, etc., old datives and not locatives,
as Schleicher and Curtius supposed; while forms like <span class =
"greek" title = "domen">δόμεν</span> are to be explained either as
abbreviated, or as obsolete accusatives.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Datives in <i>vane</i>.</h6>

<p>Of datives in <em>váne</em> I only know <ins class = "notation" title
= "printed with macron as shown"><em>dāvâne</em></ins>, a&nbsp;most
valuable grammatical relic, by which Professor Benfey was enabled to
explain the Greek <span class = "greek" title = "dounai">δοῦναι</span>,
i.e., <span class = "greek" title = "dowenai">δοϝέναι</span>.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagI_34" id = "tagI_34" href = "#noteI_34">34</a></p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Datives in <i>ane</i>.</h6>

<p>Of datives in <em>áne</em> I pointed out (l.c.) <em>dhûrv-ane</em>
and <em>vibhv-áne</em>, VI. 61, 13, taking the latter as synonymous with
<em>vibhvế</em>, and translating, <em>Sarasvatî</em>, the great, made to
conquer, like a chariot. Professor Roth, <i>s.v.</i> <em>vibhván</em>,
takes the dative for an instrumental, and translates “made by an
artificer.” It is, however, not the chariot that is spoken of, but
<em>Sarasvatî</em>, and of her it could hardly be said that she was made
either by or for an artificer.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Locatives in <i>sani</i>.</h6>

<p>As we saw before that aoristic bases in <i>s</i> take the datival
<i>e</i>, so that we had <em>prák-sh-e</em> by the side of <em class =
"sanskrit">pṛ́c-e</em>, we shall have to consider here aoristic bases in
<i>s</i>, taking the suffix <em>an</em>, not however with the
termination of the dative, but with that of the locative <i>i</i>. Thus
we read X. 126, 3, <span class = "sanskrit">náyishṭhâḥ u naḥ nesháṇi
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<a name = "page55" id = "page55"> </a>
párshishṭhâḥ u naḥ parsháṇi áti dvíshaḥ</span>, they who are the best
leaders to lead us, the best helpers to help us to overcome our enemies,
lit. in leading us, in helping us. In VIII. 12, 19, <em class =
"sanskrit">gṛṇîsháni</em>, i.e. <em class = "sanskrit">gṛ-ṇî-sháṇ-i</em>
stands parallel with <em>turv-án-e</em>, thus showing how both cases can
answer nearly the same purpose. If these forms existed in Greek, they
would, after consonantal bases, be identical with the infinitives of the
future.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Cases of Verbal Nouns in <i>tu</i>.</h6>

<p>We next come to a large number of datives, ablatives, or genitives,
and accusatives of verbal nouns in <em>tu</em>. This <em>tu</em> occurs
in Sanskrit in abstract nouns such as <em>gâtú</em>, going, way, etc.,
in Latin in <i>adven-tus</i>, etc. As these forms have been often
treated, and as some of them occur frequently in later Sanskrit also, it
will suffice to give one example of <span class =
"locked">each:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dative in <em>tave</em>: <em>gántave</em>, to go, I. 46, 7.</p>

<h6 class = "smallcaps">Datives in <i>dhai</i> and <i>dhyai</i>.</h6>

<p>I have left to the end datives in <em>dhai</em> and <em>dhyai</em>,
which properly belong to the datives in <em>ai</em>, treated before, but
differ from them as being datives of compound nouns. As from <em class =
"sanskrit">máyaḥ</em>, delight, we have <em>mayaskará</em>,
delight-making, <em>mayobhú</em>, delight-causing, and constructions
like <em>máyo dádhe</em>, so from <em>váyas</em>, life, vigor, we have
<em class = "sanskrit">váyaskṛ́t</em>, life-giving, and constructions
like <em>váyo dhât</em>. From <em>dhâ</em> we can frame two substantival
<ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: error for ‘forms’?">frame</ins>, <em>dhâ</em> and <em>dhi-s</em>, <i>e.g.</i>
<em>puro-dhâ</em>, and <em>puro-dhis</em>, like <em>vi-dhi-s</em>. As an
ordinary substantive, <em>purodhâ</em> takes the feminine termination
<i>â</i>, and is declined like <em>śivâ</em>. But if the verbal base
remains at the
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<a name = "page56" id = "page56"> </a>
end of a compound without the feminine suffix, a&nbsp;compound like
vayodhâ would form its dative vayodhe (Grammar, §&nbsp;239); and as in
analogous cases we found old datives in ai, instead of <i>e</i>, e.g.
<em>parâdai</em>, nothing can be said against <em>vayodhai</em>, as a
Vedic dative of <em>vayodhâ</em>. The dative of <em>purodhi</em> would
be <em>purodhaye</em>, but here again, as, besides forms like <span
class = "sanskrit">dṛśaye</span>, we met with datives, such as
<em>ityai</em>, <em>rohishyai</em>, there is no difficulty in admitting
an analogous dative of <em>purodhi</em>, viz., <em>purodhyai</em>.</p>

<p>The old dative <em>dhai</em> has been preserved to us in one form
only, which for that reason is all the more valuable and important,
offering the key to the mysterious Greek infinitives in <span class =
"greek" title = "thai">θαι</span>, I&nbsp;mean <em>vayodhái</em>, which
occurs twice in the Rig-Veda, X. 55, 1, and X. 67, 11. The importance of
this relic would have been perceived long ago, if there had not been
some uncertainty as to whether such a form really existed in the Veda.
By some accident or other, Professor Aufrecht had printed in both
passages <em class = "sanskrit">vayodhaiḥ</em>, instead of
<em>vayodhai</em>. But for this, no one, I&nbsp;believe, would have
doubted that in this form <em>vayodhai</em> we have not only the most
valuable prototype of the Greek infinitives in (<span class = "greek"
title = "(s)thai">σ)θαι</span>, but at the same time their full
explanation. <em>Vayodhai</em> stands for <em>vayas-dhai</em>, in which
composition the first part <em>vayas</em> is a neuter base in
<em>as</em>, the second a dative of the auxiliary verb <em>dhâ</em>,
used as a substantive. If, therefore, we find corresponding to
<em>vayodhai</em> a Greek infinitive <span class = "greek" title =
"beesthai">βέεσθαι</span>, we must divide it into <span class = "greek"
title = "bees-thai">βέεσ-θαι</span>, as we divide <span class = "greek"
title = "pseudesthai">ψεύδεσθαι</span> into <span class = "greek" title
= "pseudes-thai">ψεύδεσ-θαι</span>, and translate it literally by “to do
lying.”</p>

<p>It has been common to identify Greek infinitives in <span class =
"greek" title = "sthai">σθαι</span> with corresponding Sanskrit forms
ending in <em>dhyai</em>. No doubt these forms in <em>dhyai</em> are
much more frequent than forms in <em>dhai</em>, but as we can only take
them as old datives of substantives in <em>dhi</em>, it would be
difficult to identify the two. The Sanskrit <em>dhy</em> appears, no
doubt, in Greek, as σσ, <em>dh</em> being represented by the surd θ, and
then assibilated by <i>y</i>; but we could hardly attempt to explain σθ
= θy, because σδ = ζ = δy. Therefore, unless we are prepared to see with
Bopp in the σ before θ, in this and similar forms, a&nbsp;remnant of the
reflexive pronoun, nothing remains but to accept the explanation offered
by the Vedic <em>vayodhai</em>, and to separate <span class = "greek"
title = "pseudesthai">ψεύδεσθαι</span> into <span class = "greek" title
= "pseudes-thai">ψεύδεσ-θαι</span> lying to do. That this grammatical
compound, if once
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<a name = "page57" id = "page57"> </a>
found successful, should have been repeated in other tenses, giving us
not only <span class = "greek" title = "graphes-thai">γράφεσ-θαι</span>,
but <span class = "greek" title = "grapses-thai, grapsas-thai">γράψεσ-θαι, γράψασ-θαι</span>, and even <span class =
"greek" title = "graphthêses-thai">γραφθήσεσ-θαι</span>, is no more than
what we may see again and again in the grammatical development of
ancient and modern <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘languages. / in Some’ at line break">languages. Some</ins> scholars
have objected on the same ground to Bopp’s explanation of
<i>ama-mini</i>, as the nom. plur. of a participle, because they think
it impossible to look upon <i>amemini</i>, <i>amabâmini</i>, amaremini,
<i>amabimini</i> as participial formations. But if a mould is once made
in language, it is used again and again, and little account is taken of
its original intention. If we object to <span class = "greek" title =
"grapses-thai">γράψεσ-θαι</span>, why not to <span class = "greek" title
= "keleu-se-menai">κελευ-σέ-μεναι</span> or <span class = "greek" title
= "tethna-menai">τεθνά-μεναι</span> or <span class = "greek" title =
"michthê-menai">μιχθή-μεναι</span>? In Sanskrit, too, we should hesitate
to form a compound of a modified verbal base, such as <em class =
"sanskrit">pṛṇa</em>, with <em>dhi</em>, doing; yet as the Sanskrit ear
was accustomed to <em>yajadhyai</em> from <em>yaja</em>,
<em>gamadhyai</em> from <em>gama</em>, it did not protest against <em
class = "sanskrit">pṛṇadhyai</em>, <em class =
"sanskrit">vâvṛdhadhyai</em>, etc.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Historical Importance of these Grammatical
Forms.</h6>

<p>And while these ancient grammatical forms which supply the foundation
of what in Greek, Latin, and other languages we are accustomed to call
infinitives are of the highest interest to the grammarian and the
logician, their importance is hardly less in the eyes of the historian.
Every honest student of antiquity, whether his special field be India,
Persia, Assyria, or Egypt, knows how often he is filled with fear and
trembling when he meets with thoughts and expressions which, as he is
apt to say, cannot be ancient. I&nbsp;have frequently confessed to that
feeling with regard to some of the hymns of the Rig-Veda, and I well
remember the time when I felt inclined to throw up the whole work as
modern and unworthy of the time and labor bestowed upon it. At that time
I was always comforted by these so-called infinitives and other relics
of ancient language. They could not have been fabricated in India. They
are unknown in ordinary Sanskrit, they are unintelligible as far as
their origin is concerned in Greek and Latin, and yet in the Vedic
language we find these forms, not only identical with Greek and Latin
forms, but furnishing the key to their formation in Greece and Italy.
The Vedic <em>vayas-dhái</em> compared with Greek <span class = "greek"
title = "bees-thai">βεεσ-θαι</span>, the Vedic <em>stushe</em> compared
with <span class = "greek" title = "lusai">λυσαι</span> are to my mind
evidence in support of the antiquity and genuineness of the Veda that
cannot be shaken by any arguments.</p>

<h6 class = "smallcaps">The Infinitive in English.</h6>

<p>I add a few words on the infinitive in English, though it has been
well treated by Dr. March in his “Grammar of the Anglo-Saxon Language,”
by Dr. Morris, and others. We find in Anglo-Saxon two forms, one
generally called the infinitive, <i>nim-an</i>, to take, the other the
gerund, <i>to nim-anne</i>, to take. Dr. March explains the first as
identical with Greek <span class = "greek" title =
"nem-ein">νέμ-ειν</span> and <span class = "greek" title =
"nem-en-ai">νέμ-εν-αι</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, as an oblique case, probably
the dative, of a verbal noun in <i>an</i>. He himself quotes only the
dative of nominal bases in <i>a</i>, e.g. <em>namanâya</em>, because he
was probably unacquainted with the nearer forms in <i>an-e</i> supplied
by the Veda. This infinitive exists in Gothic as <i>nim-an</i>, in Old
Saxon as <i>nim-an</i>, in Old Norse as <i>nem-a</i>, in Old High German
as <i>nem-an</i>. The so-called gerund, to <i>nimanne</i>, is rightly
traced back by Dr. March to Old Saxon <i>nim-annia</i>, but he can
hardly be right in identifying these old datival forms with the Sanskrit
base <em>nam-anîya</em>. In the Second Period of English
(1100&ndash;1250)<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_35" id = "tagI_35" href =
"#noteI_35">35</a> the termination of the infinitive became <i>en</i>,
and frequently dropped the final <i>n</i>, as <i>smelle</i> =
<i>smellen</i>; while the termination of the gerund at the same time
became <i>enne</i>, (<i>ende</i>), <i>ene</i>, <i>en</i>, or <i>e</i>,
so that outwardly the two forms appear to be identical, as early as the
12th century.<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_36" id = "tagI_36" href =
"#noteI_36">36</a> Still later, towards the end of the 14th century, the
terminations were entirely lost, though Spenser and Shakespeare have
occasionally to <i>killen</i>, <i>passen</i>, <i>delven</i>, when they
wished to impart an archaic character to their language. In modern
English the infinitive with <i>to</i> is used as a verbal substantive.
When we say, “I&nbsp;wish you to do this,” “you are able to do this,” we
can still perceive the datival function of the infinitive. Likewise in
such phrases, “it is time,” “it is proper,” “it is wrong to do that,”
<i>to do</i> may still be felt as an oblique case. But we have only to
invert these sentences, and say, “to do this is wrong,” and we have a
new substantive in the nom. sing., just as in the Greek <span class =
"greek" title = "to legein">τὸ λέγειν</span>. Expressions like <i>for to
do</i>, show that the simple <i>to</i> was not always felt to be
sufficiently expressive to convey the meaning of an original dative.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">Works on the Infinitive.</h6>

<p>The infinitive has formed the subject of many learned treatises.
I&nbsp;divide them into two classes, those which appeared before
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<a name = "page59" id = "page59"> </a>
and after Wilhelm’s excellent essay, written in Latin, “De Infinitivi Vi
et Natura,” 1868; and in a new and improved edition, “De Infinitivo
Linguarum Sanscritæ, Bactricæ, Persicæ, Græcæ, Oscæ, Umbricæ, Latinæ,
Goticæ, forma et usu,” Isenaci, 1873. In this essay the evidence
supplied by the Veda was for the first time fully collected, and the
whole question of the nature of the infinitive placed in its true
historical light. Before Wilhelm the more important works were Hofer’s
book, “Vom Infinitiv, besonders im Sanskrit,” Berlin, 1840; Bopp’s
paragraphs in his “Comparative Grammar;” Humboldt’s paper, in Schlegel’s
“Indische Bibliothek” (II.&nbsp;74), 1824; and his posthumous paper in
Kuhn’s “Zeitschrift” (II.&nbsp;245), 1853; some dissertations by
L.&nbsp;Meyer, Merguet, and Golenski. Benfey’s “Sanskrit Grammar”
(1852), too, ought to be mentioned, as having laid the first solid
foundations for this and all other branches of grammatical research, as
far as Sanskrit is concerned. After Wilhelm the same subject has been
treated with great independence by Ludwig, “Der Infinitif im Veda,”
1871, and again “Agglutination oder Adaptation,” 1873; and also by
Jolly, “Geschichte des Infinitivs,” 1873.</p>

<p>I had myself discussed some questions connected with the nature of
the infinitive in my “Lectures on the Science of Language,” vol. ii.
p.&nbsp;15 seq., and I had pointed out in Kuhn’s “Zeitschrift,” XV. 215
(1866) the great importance of the Vedic <em>vayodhai</em> for
unraveling the formation of Greek infinitives in <span class = "greek"
title = "s-thai">σ-θαι</span>.</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">The Infinitive in Bengali.</h6>

<p>At a still earlier time, in 1847, in my “Essay on Bengali,”
I&nbsp;said: “As the infinitives of the Indo-Germanic languages must be
regarded as the absolute cases of a verbal noun, it is probable that in
Bengali the infinitive in <i>ite</i> was also originally a locative,
which expressed not only local situation, but also movement towards some
object, as an end, whether real or imaginary. Thus the Bengali
infinitive corresponds exactly with the English, where the relation of
case is expressed by the preposition <i>to</i>. Ex. tâhâke mârite âmi
âsiyâchi, means, I&nbsp;came to the state of beating him, or,
I&nbsp;came to beat him; âmâke mârite deo, give me (permission), let me
(go) to the action of beating, <i>i.e.</i>, allow me to beat. Now as the
form of the participle is the same as that of the infinitive, it may be
doubted if there is really a distinction
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<a name = "page60" id = "page60"> </a>
between these two forms as to their origin. For instance, the phrase
âpan putrake mârite âmi tâhâka dekhilâm, can be translated, I&nbsp;saw
him beating his own son; but it can be explained also as, what they
nonsensically call in Latin grammar <i>accusativus cum infinitivo</i>,
that is to say, the infinitive can be taken for a locative of the verbal
noun, and the whole phrase be translated, I&nbsp;saw him in the action
of beating his own son, (<i>vidi patrem cædere ipsius filium</i>). As in
every Bengali phrase the participle in <i>ite</i> can be understood in
this manner, I&nbsp;think it admissible to ascribe this origin to it,
and instead of taking it for a nominative of a verbal adjective, to
consider it as a locative of a verbal noun.”</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">The Infinitive in the Dravidian Languages.</h6>

<p>I also tried to show that the infinitive in the Dravidian languages
is a verbal noun with or without a case suffix. This view has been
confirmed by Dr. Caldwell, but, in deference to him, I&nbsp;gladly
withdraw the explanation which I proposed in reference to the infinitive
in Tamil. I&nbsp;quote from Dr. Caldwell’s “Comparative Grammar of the
Dravidian Languages,” 2d ed. p.&nbsp;423: “Professor Max Müller,
noticing that the majority of Tamil infinitives terminate in <i>ka</i>,
supposed this <i>ka</i> to be identical in origin with <i>kô</i>, the
dative-accusative case-sign of the Hindi, and concluded that the
Dravidian infinitive was the accusative of a verbal noun. It is true
that the Sanskrit infinitive and Latin supine in <i>tum</i> is correctly
regarded as an accusative, and that our English infinitive <i>to do</i>,
is the dative of a verbal noun; it is also true that the Dravidian
infinitive is a verbal noun in origin, and never altogether loses that
character; nevertheless, the supposition that the final <i>ka</i> of
most Tamil infinitives is <ins class = "correction" title = "text has comma ‘in,’">in</ins> any manner connected with <i>ku</i>, the sign of
the Dravidian dative, or of <i>kô</i>, the Hindi dative-accusative, is
inadmissible. A&nbsp;comparison of various classes of verbs and of the
various dialects shows that the <i>kâ</i> in question proceeds from a
totally different source.”</p>


<h6 class = "smallcaps">On Labialized and Unlabialized Gutturals.</h6>

<p>As in my article on <i>Vayodhai</i>, published in Kuhn’s
“Zeitschrift,” 1866, p.&nbsp;215, I&nbsp;had entered a <i>caveat</i>
against identifying Greek β with Sanskrit <span class = "greek" title =
"[Sanskrit] ja">ज</span>, I&nbsp;take this opportunity of frankly
withdrawing it. Phonetically, no doubt, these two letters represent
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<a name = "page61" id = "page61"> </a>
totally distinct powers, and to say that Sanskrit <span class = "greek"
title = "[Sanskrit] ja">ज</span> ever became Greek β is as irrational
to-day as it was ten years ago. But historically I was entirely wrong,
as will be seen from the last edition of Curtius’ “Grundzüge.” The
guttural sonant check was palatalized in the Southeastern Branch, and
there became j and <i>z</i>, while in the Northwestern Branch the same g
was frequently labialized and became gv, v, and&nbsp;b. Hence, where we
have <span class = "greek" title = "[Sanskrit] ja">ज</span> in Sanskrit,
we may and do find β in Greek.</p>

<p>But after withdrawing my former <i>caveat</i>, I make bold to propose
another, namely, that the original palatal sonant flatus, which in
Sanskrit is graphically represented by j, can never be represented in
Greek by β. Whether j in Sanskrit represents an original palatal sonant
check or an original palatal sonant flatus can generally be determined
by a reference to Zend, which represents the former by j, the latter by
<i>z</i>. We may therefore formulate this phonetic <span class =
"locked">law:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>“When Sanskrit j is represented by Zend <i>z</i>, it cannot be
represented by Greek β.”</em></p>

<p>In this manner it is possible, I believe, to utilize Ascoli’s and
Fick’s brilliant discovery as to a twofold, or even threefold,
distinction of the Aryan k, as applied to the Aryan&nbsp;g. They have
proved that all Aryan languages show traces of an original distinction
between a guttural surd check, k, frequently palatalized in the
Southeastern Branch (Sk.&nbsp;c, Zend&nbsp;c) and liable to
labialization, in Latin, Greek, Cymric, and Gothic; and another k, never
liable to labialization, but changed into a flatus, palatal or
otherwise, in Sanskrit, Lithuanian, and Old Slavonic. They showed, in
<span class = "locked">fact,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the same manner we ought in future to distinguish between a
guttural sonant check, g, frequently palatalized in the Southeastern
Branch (Sk.&nbsp;j, Zend&nbsp;j), and liable to labialization, like k;
and another g, never liable to labialization, but changed into a flatus,
palatal or otherwise, in Zend, Lithuanian, and Old Slavonic. As we never
have π = <span class = "greek" title = "[Sanskrit] śa">श</span> we never

In the dictionary of Boehtlingk and Roth we read <i>s.v.</i>
<em>gnâ</em>, “scarce in the singular; nom. sing. seems to be
<em>gnâs</em>, according to the passage Rv. IV. 9, 4, and Naigh.
I.&nbsp;11, in one text, while the other text gives the form
<em>gnâ</em>.” Against this, it should be remarked, that it would make
no difference whether the MSS. of the <span class =
"sanskrit">Naighaṇṭuka</span> give <em>gnâ</em> or <em>gnâs</em>.
<em>Gnâ</em> would be the nom. sing., <em>gnâs</em> would be the form in
which the word occurs most frequently in the Veda. It is easy to see
that the collector of the <span class = "sanskrit">Naighaṇṭuka</span>
allowed himself to quote words according to either principle.</p>

<p class = "continue">
Devarâja, in his commentary on <em>gnâ</em>, explains it: “<span class =
"sanskrit">Gamer dhâtor dhâpṛ́vasya&shy;jyatibhyo naḥ</span> (U.&nbsp;S.

<p class = "continue">
In his remarks on Nigh. III. 29, it is quite clear that Devarâja takes
<em class = "sanskrit">gnâḥ</em> as a nom. plur., not as a nom. sing. He
says: <span class = "sanskrit">Menâ gnâ iti stríṇâm; ubhâv api śabdau
vyâkhyâtau vânnâmasu. Mânayanti hi tâḥ patiśvaśuramátulâdayaḥ, pûjyâ

The passage quoted in the Nirukta III. 29, <span class = "sanskrit">gnâs
tvâkṛntann apaso ’tanvata vayitryo ’vayan</span>, is taken from the
<span class = "sanskrit">Tâṇḍyabrâhmaṇa</span> I.&nbsp;8, 9.
“O&nbsp;dress! the women cut thee out, the workers stretched thee out,
the weavers wove thee.”</p>

<p class = "continue">
Thus every support which the <span class = "sanskrit">Nighaṇṭu</span> or
the Nirukta was supposed to give to the form <em class =
"sanskrit">gnâḥ</em> as a nom. sing. vanishes. And if it is said
<i>s.v.</i> <em>gnâspati</em>, that in this compound <em class =
"sanskrit">gnâḥ</em> might be taken as a nom. sing., and that the
Pada-text separates <em class = "sanskrit">gnâḥ-patiḥ</em>, it has been
overlooked that the separation in Rv. II. 38, 10, is a mere misprint.
See Prâtiśâkhya, 738. The compound <em class = "sanskrit">gnâspatiḥ</em>
has been correctly explained as standing for <em class =
"sanskrit">gnâyâspatiḥ</em>, and the same old genitive is also found in
<em class = "sanskrit">jâspatiḥ</em> and <em>jâspatyam</em>. See also
Vâjasan. Prâtiśâkhya, IV. 39. It is important to observe that the metre
requires us to pronounce <em>gnâspati</em> either as <em class =
"sanskrit">gnăāspătĭḥ</em> or as <em class =
"sanskrit">gănāspătĭḥ</em>.</p>

<p class = "continue">
There is, as far as I know, no passage where <em class =
"sanskrit">gnâḥ</em> in the Veda can be taken as a nom. sing., and it
should be observed that <em class = "sanskrit">gnâḥ</em> as nom. plur.
is almost always disyllabic in the Rig-veda, excepting the tenth <span
class = "sanskrit">Maṇḍala</span>; that the acc. sing.
(V.&nbsp;43,&nbsp;6) is, however, disyllabic, but the acc. plur.
monosyllabic (I.&nbsp;22,&nbsp;10). In V.&nbsp;43, 13, we must either
read <em class = "sanskrit">gn̆āḥ</em> or <em class =

<p><span class = "firstword">There</span> are few sensations more
pleasant than that of wondering. We have all experienced it in
childhood, in youth, and in our manhood, and we may hope that even in
our old age this affection of the mind will not entirely pass away. If
we analyze this feeling of wonder carefully, we shall find that it
consists of two elements. What we mean by wondering is not only that we
are startled or stunned,&mdash;that I should call the merely passive
element of wonder. When we say “I&nbsp;wonder,” we confess that we are
taken aback, but there is a secret satisfaction mixed up with our
feeling of surprise, a&nbsp;kind of hope, nay, almost of certainty, that
sooner or later the wonder will cease, that our senses or our mind will
recover, will grapple with these novel impressions or experiences, grasp
them, it may be, throw them, and finally triumph over them. In fact we
wonder at the riddles
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
<a name = "page64" id = "page64"> </a>
of nature, whether animate or inanimate, with a firm conviction that
there is a solution to them all, even though we ourselves may not be
able to find it.</p>

<p>Wonder, no doubt, arises from ignorance, but from a peculiar kind of
ignorance; from what might be called a fertile ignorance: an ignorance
which, if we look back at the history of most of our sciences, will be
found to have been the mother of all human knowledge. For thousands of
years men have looked at the earth with its stratifications, in some
places so clearly mapped out; for thousands of years they must have seen
in their quarries and mines, as well as we ourselves, the imbedded
petrifications of organic creatures: yet they looked and passed on
without thinking more about it&mdash;they did not wonder. Not even an
Aristotle had eyes to see; and the conception of a science of the earth,
of Geology, was reserved for the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Still more extraordinary is the listlessness with which during all
the centuries that have elapsed since the first names were given to all
cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field, men
have passed by what was much nearer to them than even the gravel on
which they trod, namely, the words of their own language. Here, too, the
clearly marked lines of different strata seemed almost to challenge
attention, and the pulses of former life were still throbbing in the
petrified forms imbedded in grammars and dictionaries. Yet not even a
Plato had eyes to see, or ears to hear, and the conception of a science
of language, of Glottology, was reserved for the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>I am far from saying that Plato and Aristotle knew nothing of the
nature, the origin, and the purpose of
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<a name = "page65" id = "page65"> </a>
language, or that we have nothing to learn from their works. They, and
their successors, and their predecessors too, beginning with Herakleitos
and Demokritos, were startled and almost fascinated by the mysteries of
human speech as much as by the mysteries of human thought; and what we
call grammar and the laws of language, nay, all the technical terms
which are still current in our schools, such as <i>noun</i> and
<i>verb</i>, <i>case</i> and <i>number</i>, <i>infinitive</i> and
<i>participle</i>, all this was first discovered and named by the
philosophers and grammarians of Greece, to whom, in spite of all our new
discoveries, I&nbsp;believe we are still beholden, whether consciously
or unconsciously, for more than half of our intellectual life.</p>

<p>But the interest which those ancient Greek philosophers took in
language was purely philosophical. It was the form, far more than the
matter of speech which seemed to them a subject worthy of philosophical
speculation. The idea that there was, even in their days, an immense
mass of accumulated speech to be sifted, to be analyzed, and to be
accounted for somehow, before any theories on the nature of language
could be safely started, hardly ever entered their minds; or when it
did, as we see here and there in Plato’s “Kratylos,” it soon vanished,
without leaving any permanent impression. Each people and each
generation has its own problems to solve. The problem that occupied
Plato in his “Kratylos” was, if I understand him rightly, the
possibility of a perfect language, a&nbsp;correct, true, or ideal
language, a&nbsp;language founded on his own philosophy, his own system
of types or ideas. He was too wise a man to attempt, like Bishop
Wilkins, the actual construction of a philosophical language. But, like
Leibniz, he just
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
<a name = "page66" id = "page66"> </a>
lets us see that a perfect language is conceivable, and that the chief
reason of the imperfections of real language must be found in the fact
that its original framers were ignorant of the true nature of things,
ignorant of dialectic philosophy, and therefore incapable of naming
rightly what they had failed to apprehend correctly. Plato’s view of
actual language, as far as it can be made out from the critical and
negative rather than didactic and positive dialogue of “Kratylos,” seems
to have been very much the same as his view of actual government. Both
fall short of the ideal, and both are to be tolerated only in so far as
they participate in the perfections of an ideal state and an ideal
language.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_2" id = "tagII_2" href =
"#noteII_2">2</a> Plato’s “Kratylos” is full of suggestive wisdom. It is
one of those books which, as we read them again from time to time, seem
every time like new books: so little do we perceive at first all that is
pre-supposed in them,&mdash;the accumulated mould of thought, if I may
say so, in which alone a philosophy like that of Plato could strike its
roots and draw its support.</p>

<p>But while Plato shows a deeper insight into the mysteries of language
than almost any philosopher that has come after him, he has no eyes for
that marvelous harvest of words garnered up in our dictionaries, and in
the dictionaries of all the races of the earth. With him language is
almost synonymous with Greek, and though in one passage of the
“Kratylos” he suggests that certain Greek words might have been borrowed
from the Barbarians, and, more particularly from the Phrygians, yet that
remark, as coming from Plato, seems to be purely ironical, and though it
contains, as we know, a&nbsp;germ of truth that
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<a name = "page67" id = "page67"> </a>
has proved most fruitful in our modern science of language, it struck no
roots in the minds of Greek philosophers. How much our new science of
language differs from the linguistic studies of the Greeks; how entirely
the interest which Plato took in language is now supplanted by new
interests, is strikingly brought home to us when we see how the
<i>Société de Linguistique</i>, lately founded at Paris, and including
the names of the most distinguished scholars of France, declares in one
of its first statutes that “it will receive no communication concerning
the origin of language or the formation of a universal language,” the
very subjects which, in the time of Herakleitos and Plato, rendered
linguistic studies worthy of the consideration of a philosopher.</p>

<p>It may be that the world was too young in the days of Plato, and that
the means of communication were wanting to enable the ancient
philosopher to see very far beyond the narrow horizon of Greece. With us
it is different. The world has grown older, and has left to us in the
annals of its various literatures the monuments of growing and decaying
speech. The world has grown larger, and we have before us, not only the
relics of ancient civilization in Asia, Africa, and America, but living
languages in such number and variety that we draw back almost aghast at
the mere list of their names. The world has grown wiser too, and where
Plato could only see imperfections, the failures of the founders of
human speech, we see, as everywhere else in human life, a&nbsp;natural
progress from the imperfect towards the perfect, unceasing attempts at
realizing the ideal, and the frequent triumphs of the human mind over
the inevitable difficulties of this earthly
condition,&mdash;difficulties,
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
<a name = "page68" id = "page68"> </a>
not of man’s own making, but, as I firmly believe, prepared for him, and
not without a purpose, as toils and tasks, by a higher Power and by the
highest Wisdom.</p>

<p>Let us look then abroad and behold the materials which the student of
language has now to face. Beginning with the language of the Western
Isles, we have at the present day, at least 100,000 words, arranged as
on the shelves of a Museum, in the pages of Johnson and Webster. But
these 100,000 words represent only the best grains that have remained in
the sieve, while clouds of chaff have been winnowed off, and while many
a valuable grain too has been lost by mere carelessness. If we counted
the wealth of English dialects, and if we added the treasures of the
ancient language from Alfred to Wycliffe, we should easily double the
herbarium of the linguistic flora of England. And what are these Western
Isles as compared to Europe; and what is Europe, a&nbsp;mere promontory,
as compared to the vast continent of Asia; and what again is Asia, as
compared to the whole inhabitable world? But there is no corner of that
world that is not full of language: the very desert and the isles of the
sea teem with dialects, and the more we recede from the centres of
civilization, the larger the number of independent languages, springing
up in every valley, and overshadowing the smallest island.</p>

<p>We are bewildered by the variety of plants, of birds, and fishes, and
insects, scattered with lavish prodigality over land and sea;&mdash;but
what is the living
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<a name = "page69" id = "page69"> </a>
wealth of that Fauna as compared to the winged words which fill the air
with unceasing music! What are the scanty relics of fossil plants and
animals, compared to the storehouse of what we call the dead languages!
How then can we explain it that for centuries and centuries, while
collecting beasts, and birds, and fishes, and insects, while studying
their forms, from the largest down to the smallest and almost invisible
creatures, man has passed by this forest of speech, without seeing the
forest, as we say in German, for the very number of its trees (<i>Man
sah den Wald vor lauter Bäumen nicht</i>), without once asking how this
vast currency could have been coined, what inexhaustible mines could
have supplied the metal, what cunning hands could have devised the image
and superscription,&mdash;without once wondering at the countless
treasure inherited by him from the fathers of the human race?</p>

<p>Let us now turn our attention in a different direction. After it had
been discovered that there was this great mass of material to be
collected, to be classified, to be explained, what has the Science of
Language, as yet, really accomplished? It has achieved much, considering
that real work only began about fifty years ago; it has achieved little,
if we look at what still remains to be done.</p>

<p>The first discovery was that languages admit of classification. Now
this was a very great discovery, and it at once changed and raised the
whole character of linguistic studies. Languages might have been, for
all we know, the result of individual fancy or poetry; words might have
been created here and there at random, or been fixed by a convention,
more or less arbitrary. In that case a scientific classification would
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
<a name = "page70" id = "page70"> </a>
have been as impossible as it is if applied to the changing fashions of
the day. Nothing can be classified, nothing can be scientifically ruled
and ordered, except what has grown up in natural order and according to
rational rule.</p>

<p>Out of the great mass of speech that is now accessible to the student
of language, a&nbsp;number of so-called families have been separated,
such as the <i>Aryan</i>, the <i>Semitic</i>, the <i>Ural-Altaic</i>,
the <i>Indo-Chinese</i>, the <i>Dravidian</i>, the
<i>Malayo-Polynesian</i>, the <i>Kafir</i> or <i>Bâ-ntu</i> in Africa,
and the <i>Polysynthetic</i> dialects of America. The only classes,
however, which have been carefully examined, and which alone have
hitherto supplied the materials for what we might call the Philosophy of
Language, are the Aryan and the Semitic, the former comprising the
languages of India, Persia, Armenia, Greece and Italy, and of the
Celtic, Teutonic, and Slavonic races; the latter consisting of the
languages of the Babylonians, the Syrians, the Jews, the Ethiopians, the
Arabs.</p>

<p>These two classes include, no doubt, the most important languages of
the world, if we measure the importance of languages by the amount of
influence exercised on the political and literary history of the world
by those who speak them. But considered by themselves, and placed in
their proper place in the vast realm of human speech, they describe but
a very small segment of the entire circle. The completeness of the
evidence which they place before us in the long series of their literary
treasures, points them out in an eminent degree as the most useful
subjects on which to study the anatomy of speech, and nearly all the
discoveries that have been made as to the laws of language, the process
of composition, derivation, and
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<a name = "page71" id = "page71"> </a>
inflexion, have been gained by Aryan and Semitic scholars.</p>

<p>Far be it from me, therefore, to underrate the value of Aryan and
Semitic scholarship for a successful prosecution of the Science of
Language. But while doing full justice to the method adopted by Semitic
and Aryan scholars in the discovery of the laws that regulate the growth
and decay of language, we must not shut our eyes to the fact that our
field of observation has been thus far extremely limited, and that we
should act in defiance of the simplest rules of sound induction, were we
to generalize on such scanty evidence. Let us but clearly see what place
these two so-called families, the Aryan and Semitic, occupy in the great
kingdom of speech. They are in reality but two centres, two small
settlements of speech, and all we know of them is their period of decay,
not their period of growth, their descending, not their ascending
career, their Being, as we say in German, not their Becoming (<i>Ihr
Gewordensein, nicht ihr Werden</i>). Even in the earliest literary
documents both the Aryan and Semitic speech appear before us as fixed
and petrified. They had left forever that stage during which language
grows and expands, before it is arrested in its exuberant fertility by
means of religious or political concentration, by means of oral
tradition, or finally by means of a written literature. In the natural
history of speech, writing, or, what in early times takes the place of
writing, oral tradition, is something merely accidental. It represents a
foreign influence which, in natural history, can only be compared to the
influence exercised by domestication on plants and animals. Language
would be language still, nay,
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
<a name = "page72" id = "page72"> </a>
would be more truly language, if the idea of a literature, whether oral
or written, had never entered men’s minds; and however important the
effects produced by this artificial domestication of language may be, it
is clear that our ideas of what language is in a natural state, and
therefore what Sanskrit and Hebrew, too, must have been before they were
tamed and fixed by literary cultivation, ought not to be formed from an
exclusive study of Aryan and Semitic speech. I&nbsp;maintain that all
that we call Aryan and Semitic speech, wonderful as its literary
representatives may be, consists of neither more or less than so many
varieties which all owe their origin to only two historical
concentrations of wild unbounded speech; nay, however perfect, however
powerful, however glorious in the history of the world,&mdash;in the
eyes of the student of language, Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, Hebrew,
Arabic, and Syriac, are what a student of natural history would not
hesitate to call “<i>monstra</i>,” unnatural, exceptional formations
which can never disclose to us the real character of language left to
itself to follow out its own laws without let or hindrance.</p>

<p>For that purpose a study of Chinese and the Turanian dialects,
a&nbsp;study even of the jargons of the savages of Africa, Polynesia,
and Melanesia is far more instructive than the most minute analysis of
Sanskrit and Hebrew. The impression which a study of Greek and Latin and
Sanskrit leaves on our minds is, that language is a work of art, most
complicated, most wonderful, most perfect. We have given so many names
to its outward features, its genders and cases, its tenses and moods,
its participles, gerunds, and supines, that at last we are frightened at
our own devices. Who can read through all the so-called
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
<a name = "page73" id = "page73"> </a>
irregular verbs, or look at the thousands and thousands of words in a
Greek Dictionary without feeling that he moves about in a perfect
labyrinth? How then, we ask, was this labyrinth erected? How did all
this come to be? We ourselves, speaking the language which we speak,
move about, as it were, in the innermost chambers, in the darkest
recesses of that primeval palace, but we cannot tell by what steps and
through what passages we arrived there, and we look in vain for the
thread of Ariadne which in leading us out of the enchanted castle of our
language, would disclose to us the way by which we ourselves, or our
fathers and forefathers before us, entered into it.</p>

<p>The question how language came to be what it is has been asked again
and again. Even a school-boy, if he possesses but a grain of the gift of
wondering must ask himself why <i>mensa</i> means one table, and
<i>mensæ</i> many tables; why I love should be <i>amo</i>, I am loved
<i>amor</i>, I shall love <i>amabo</i>, I have loved <i>amavi</i>, I
should have loved <i>amavissem</i>. Until very lately two answers only
could have been given to such questions. Both sound to us almost absurd,
yet in their time they were supported by the highest authorities.
Either, it was said, language, and particularly the grammatical
framework of language was made by <i>convention</i>, by agreeing to call
one table <i>mensa</i>, and many tables <i>mensæ</i>; or, and this was
Schlegel’s view, language was declared to possess an organic life, and
its terminations, prefixes, and suffixes were supposed to have sprouted
forth from the radicals and stems and branches of language, like so many
buds and flowers. To us it seems almost incredible that such theories
should have been seriously maintained, and
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<a name = "page74" id = "page74"> </a>
maintained by men of learning and genius. But what better answer could
they have given? What better answer has been given even now? We have
learnt something, chiefly from a study of the modern dialects, which
often repeat the processes of ancient speech, and thus betray the
secrets of the family. We have learnt that in some of the dialects of
modern Sanskrit, in Bengali for instance,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_4" id = "tagII_4" href = "#noteII_4">4</a> the plural is formed,
as it is in Chinese, Mongolian, Turkish, Finnish, Burmese, and Siamese,
also in the Dravidian and Malayo-Polynesian dialects, by adding a word
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<a name = "page75" id = "page75"> </a>
expressive of plurality, and then appending again the terminations of
the singular. We have learnt from French how a future, <i>je
parlerai</i>, can be formed by an auxiliary verb: “I&nbsp;to speak have”
coming to mean, I&nbsp;shall speak. We have learnt from our own
language, whether English or German, that suffixes, such as <i>head</i>
in <i>godhead</i>, <i>ship</i> in <i>ladyship</i>, <i>dom</i> in
<i>kingdom</i> were originally substantives, having the meaning of
quality, shape, and state. But I doubt whether even thus we should have
arrived at a thorough understanding of the real antecedents of language,
unless, what happened in the study of the stratification of the earth,
had happened in the study of language. If the formation of the crust of
the earth had been throughout regular and uniform, and if none of the
lower strata had been tilted up, so that even those who run might read,
no shaft from the surface could have been sunk deep enough to bring the
geologist from the tertiary strata down to the Silurian rocks. The same
in language. Unless some languages had been arrested in their growth
during their earlier stages, and had remained on the surface in this
primitive state exposed only to the decomposing influence of atmospheric
action, and to the ill-treatment of literary cultivation, I&nbsp;doubt
whether any scholar would have had the courage to say that at one time
Sanskrit was like unto Chinese, and Hebrew no better than Malay. In the
successive strata of language thus exposed to our view, we have in fact,
as in Geology, the very thread of Ariadne, which, if we will but trust
to it, will lead us out of the dark labyrinth of language in which we
live, by the same road by which we and those who came before us, first
entered into it. The more we retrace our steps, the
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<a name = "page76" id = "page76"> </a>
more we advance from stratum to stratum, from story to story, the more
shall we feel almost dazzled by the daylight that breaks in upon us; the
more shall we be struck, no longer by the intricacy of Greek or Sanskrit
grammar, but by the marvelous simplicity of the original warp of human
speech, as preserved, for instance, in Chinese; by the child-like
contrivances, that are at the bottom of Paulo-post Futures and
Conditional Moods.</p>

<p>Let no one be frightened at the idea of studying a Chinese grammar.
Those who can take an interest in the secret springs of the mind, in the
elements of pure reason, in the laws of thought, will find a Chinese
grammar most instructive, most fascinating. It is the faithful
photograph of man in his leading-strings, trying the muscles of his
mind, groping his way, and so delighted with his first successful grasps
that he repeats them again and again. It is child’s play, if you like,
but it displays, like all child’s play, that wisdom and strength which
are perfect in the mouth of babes and sucklings. Every shade of thought
that finds expression in the highly finished and nicely balanced system
of Greek tenses, moods, and particles can be expressed, and has been
expressed, in that infant language by words that have neither prefix nor
suffix, no terminations to indicate number, case, tense, mood, or
person. Every word in Chinese is monosyllabic, and the same word,
without any change of form, may be used as a noun, a&nbsp;verb, an
adjective, an adverb, or a particle. Thus <i>ta</i>, according to its
position in a sentence, may mean great, greatness, to grow, very much,
very.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_5" id = "tagII_5" href =
"#noteII_5">5</a></p>

<p>And here a very important observation has been
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page77" id = "page77"> </a>
made by Chinese grammarians, an observation which, after a very slight
modification and expansion, contains indeed the secret of the whole
growth of language from Chinese to English. If a word in Chinese is used
with the <i>bonâ fide</i> signification of a noun or a verb, it is
called a <i>full word</i> (<i>shi-tsé</i>); if it is used as a particle
or with a merely determinative or formal character, it is called an
<i>empty word</i> (<i>hiu-tsé</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagII_6" id =
"tagII_6" href = "#noteII_6">6</a>). There is as yet no outward
difference between full and empty words in Chinese, and this renders it
all the more creditable to the grammarians of China that they should
have perceived the inward distinction, even in the absence of any
outward signs.</p>

<p>Let us learn then from Chinese grammarians this great lesson, that
words may become empty, and without restricting the meaning of empty
words as they do, let us use that term in the most general sense, as
expressive of the fact that words may lose something of their full
original meaning.</p>

<p>Let us add to this another observation, which the Chinese could not
well have made, but which we shall see confirmed again and again in the
history of language, viz.: that empty words, or, as we may also call
them, dead words, are most exposed to phonetic decay.</p>

<p>It is clear then that, with these two preliminary
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<a name = "page78" id = "page78"> </a>
observations, we can imagine three conditions of <span class =
"locked">language:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. There may be languages in which all words, both empty and full,
retain their independent form. Even words which are used when we should
use mere suffixes or terminations, retain their outward integrity in
Chinese. Thus, in Chinese, <i>jin</i> means man, <i>tu</i> means crowd,
<i>jin-tu</i>, man-crowd. In this compound both <i>jin</i> and <i>tu</i>
continue to be felt as independent words, more so than in our own
compound <i>man-kind</i>; but nevertheless <i>tu</i> has become empty,
it only serves to determine the preceding word <i>jin</i>, man, and
tells us the quantity or number in which <i>jin</i> shall be taken. The
compound answers in intention to our plural, but in form it is wide
apart from <i>men</i>, the plural of <i>man</i>.</p>

<p>2. Empty words may lose their independence, may suffer phonetic
decay, and dwindle down to mere suffixes and terminations. Thus in
Burmese the plural is formed by <i>to</i>, in Finnish, Mordvinian, and
Ostiakian by <i>t</i>. As soon as <i>to</i> ceases to be used as an
independent word in the sense of number, it becomes an empty, or if you
like, an obsolete word, that has no meaning except as the exponent of
plurality; nay, at last, it may dwindle down to a mere letter, which is
then called by grammarians the termination of the plural. In this second
stage phonetic decay may well-nigh destroy the whole body of an empty
word, but&mdash;and this is important&mdash;no full words, no radicals
are as yet attacked by that disintegrating process.</p>

<p>3. Phonetic decay may advance, and does advance still further. Full
words also may lose their independence, and be attacked by the same
disease that
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<a name = "page79" id = "page79"> </a>
had destroyed the original features of suffixes and prefixes. In this
state it is frequently impossible to distinguish any longer between the
radical and formative elements of words.</p>

<p>If we wished to represent these three stages of language
algebraically, we might represent the first by RR, using R as the symbol
of a root which has suffered no phonetic decay; the second, by R + ρ or
ρ + R, or ρ + R + ρ representing by ρ an empty word that has suffered
phonetic change; the third, by rρ, or ρr, or ρrρ, when both full and
empty words have been changed, and have become welded together into one
indistinguishable mass through the intense heat of thought, and by the
constant hammering of the tongue.</p>

<p>Those who are acquainted with the works of Humboldt will easily
recognize, in these three stages or strata, a&nbsp;classification of
language first suggested by that eminent philosopher. According to him
languages can be classified as <i>isolating</i>, <i>agglutinative</i>,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_7" id = "tagII_7" href = "#noteII_7">7</a>
and <i>inflectional</i>, and his definition of these three classes
agrees in the main with the description just given of the three strata
or stages of language.</p>

<p>But what is curious is that this threefold classification, and the
consequences to which it leads, should not at once have been fully
reasoned out, nay, that a system most palpably erroneous should have
been founded upon it. We find it repeated again and again in most works
on Comparative Philology, that Chinese belongs to the <i>isolating</i>
class, the Turanian languages to the <i>combinatory</i>, the Aryan and
Semitic
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
<a name = "page80" id = "page80"> </a>
to the <i>inflectional</i>; nay, Professor Pott<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_8" id = "tagII_8" href = "#noteII_8">8</a> and his school seem
convinced that no evolution can ever take place from <i>isolating</i> to
<i>combinatory</i> and from <i>combinatory</i> to <i>inflectional</i>
speech. We should thus be forced to believe that by some inexplicable
grammatical instinct, or by some kind of inherent necessity, languages
were from the beginning created as <i>isolating</i> or
<i>combinatory</i>, or <i>inflectional</i>, and must remain so to the
end.</p>

<p>It is strange that those scholars who hold that no transition is
possible from one form of language to another, should not have seen that
there is really no language that can be strictly called either
isolating, or combinatory, or inflectional, and that the transition from
one stage to another is in fact constantly taking
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<a name = "page81" id = "page81"> </a>
place under our very noses. Even Chinese is not free from combinatory
forms, and the more highly developed among the combinatory languages
show the clearest traces of incipient inflection. The difficulty is not
to show the transition of one stratum of speech into another, but rather
to draw a sharp line between the different strata. The same difficulty
was felt in Geology, and led Sir Charles Lyell to invent such pliant
names as <i>Eocene</i>, <i>Meiocene</i>, and <i>Pleiocene</i>, names
which indicate a mere dawn, a&nbsp;minority, or a majority of new
formations, but do not draw a fast and hard line, cutting off one
stratum from the other. Natural growth, and even merely mechanical
accumulation and accretion, here as elsewhere, are so minute and almost
imperceptible that they defy all strict scientific terminology, and
force upon us the lesson that we must be satisfied with an approximate
accuracy. For practical purposes Humboldt’s classification of languages
may be quite sufficient, and we have no difficulty in classing any given
language, according to the prevailing character of its formation, as
either isolating, or combinatory, or inflectional. But when we analyze
each language more carefully we find there is not one exclusively
isolating, or exclusively combinatory, or exclusively inflectional. The
power of composition, which is retained unimpaired through every
stratum, can at any moment place an inflectional on a level with an
isolating and a combinatory language. A&nbsp;compound such as the
Sanskrit <em>go-duh</em>, cow-milking, differs little, if at all, from
the Chinese <i>nieou-jou</i>, <i>vaccæ lac</i>, or in the patois of
Canton, <i>ngau ü</i>, cow-milk, before it takes the terminations of the
nominative, which is, of course, impossible in Chinese.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<a name = "page82" id = "page82"> </a>
<p>So again in English <i>New-town</i>, in Greek <i>Nea-polis</i>, would
be simply combinatory compounds. Even <i>Newton</i> would still belong
to the combinatory stratum; but <i>Naples</i> would have to be classed
as belonging to the inflectional stage.</p>

<p>Finnish, Hungarian, Turkish, and the Dravidian languages belong in
the main to the combinatory stratum; but having received a considerable
amount of literary cultivation, they all alike exhibit forms which in
every sense of the word are inflectional. If in Finnish, for instance,
we find <i>käsi</i>, in the singular, hand, and <i>kädet</i>, in the
plural, hands, we see that phonetic corruption has clearly reached the
very core of the noun, and given rise to a plural more decidedly
inflectional than the Greek <span class = "greek" title =
"cheir-es">χεῖρ-ες</span>, or the English <i>hand-s</i>. In Tamil, where
the suffix of the plural is <em class = "sanskrit">gaḷ</em>, we have
indeed a regular combinatory form in <em class =
"sanskrit">kei-gaḷ</em>, hands; but if the same plural suffix <em class
= "sanskrit">gaḷ</em> is added to <em>kal</em>, stone, the euphonic
rules of Tamil require not only a change in the suffix, which becomes
<em class = "sanskrit">kaḷ</em>, but likewise a modification in the body
of the word, <em>kal</em> being changed to <em>kar</em>. We thus get the
plural <em class = "sanskrit">karkaḷ</em> which in every sense of the
word is an inflectional form. In this plural suffix <em class =
"sanskrit">gaḷ</em>, Dr. Caldwell has recognized the Dravidian <em class
= "sanskrit">taḷa</em> or <em class = "sanskrit">daḷa</em>, a host,
a&nbsp;crowd; and though, as he admits himself in the second edition
(p.&nbsp;143), the evidence in support of this etymology may not be
entirely satisfactory, the steps by which the learned author of the
Grammar of the Dravidian languages has traced the plural termination
<em>lu</em> in Telugu back to the same original suffix <em class =
"sanskrit">kaḷ</em> admit of little doubt.</p>

<p>Evidence of a similar kind may easily be found in any grammar,
whether of an isolating, combinatory,
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<a name = "page83" id = "page83"> </a>
or inflectional language, wherever there is evidence as to the ascending
or descending progress of any particular form of speech. Everywhere
amalgamation points back to combination, and combination back to
juxtaposition, everywhere isolating speech tends towards terminational
forms, and terminational forms become inflectional.</p>

<p>I may best be able to explain the view commonly held with regard to
the strata of language by a reference to the strata of the earth. Here,
too, where different strata have been tilted up, it might seem at first
sight as if they were arranged perpendicularly and side by side, none
underlying the other, none presupposing the other. But as the geologist,
on the strength of more general evidence, has to reverse this
perpendicular position, and to re-arrange his strata in their natural
order, and as they followed each other horizontally, the student of
language too is irresistibly driven to the same conclusion. No language
can by any possibility be inflectional without having passed through the
combinatory and isolating stratum; no language can by any possibility be
combinatory without clinging with its roots to the underlying stratum of
isolation. Unless Sanskrit and Greek and Hebrew had passed through the
combinatory stratum, nay, unless, at some time or other, they had been
no better than Chinese, their present form would be as great a miracle
as the existence of chalk (and the strata associated with&nbsp;it)
without an underlying stratum of oolite (and the strata associated
with&nbsp;it;) or a stratum of oolite unsupported by the trias or system
of new red sandstone. Bunsen’s dictum, that “the question whether a
language can begin with inflections, implies an absurdity,” may have
seemed too
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<a name = "page84" id = "page84"> </a>
strongly worded: but if he took inflections in the commonly received
meaning, in the sense of something that may be added or removed from a
base in order to define or to modify its meaning, then surely the simple
argument <i>ex nihilo nihil fit</i> is sufficient to prove that the
inflections must have been something by themselves, before they became
inflections relatively to the base, and that the base too must have
existed by itself, before it could be defined and modified by the
addition of such inflections.</p>

<p>But we need not depend on purely logical arguments, when we have
historical evidence to appeal to. As far as we know the history of
language, we see it everywhere confined within those three great strata
or zones which we have just described. There are inflectional changes,
no doubt, which cannot as yet be explained, such as the <i>m</i> in the
accusative singular of masculine, feminine, and in the nominative and
accusative of neuter nouns; or the change of vowels between the Hebrew
<i>Piel</i> and <i>Pual</i>, <i>Hiphil</i> and <i>Hophal</i>, where we
might feel tempted to admit formative agencies different from
juxtaposition and combination. But if we consider how in Sanskrit the
Vedic instrumental plural, <em>aśvebhis</em> (Lat. <i>equobus</i>),
becomes before our very eyes <em>aśvais</em> (Lat. <i>equis</i>), and
how such changes as <i>Bruder</i>, brother, and <i>Brüder</i>, brethren,
<i>Ich weiss</i>, I know, A.S. <i>wât</i>, and <i>Wir wissen</i>, we
know, A.S. <i>wit-on</i>, have been explained as the results of purely
mechanical, <i>i.e.</i>, combinatory proceedings, we need not despair of
further progress in the same direction. One thing is certain, that,
wherever inflection has yielded to a rational analysis, it has
invariably been recognized as the result of a previous combination, and
wherever combination has
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<a name = "page85" id = "page85"> </a>
been traced back to an earlier stage, that earlier stage has been simple
juxtaposition. The primitive blocks of Chinese and the most perplexing
agglomerates of Greek can be explained as the result of one continuous
formative process, whatever the material elements may be on which it was
exercised; nor is it possible even to imagine in the formation of
language more than these three strata through which hitherto all human
speech has passed.</p>

<p>All we can do is to subdivide each stratum, and thus, for instance,
distinguish in the second stratum the suffixing (R&nbsp;+&nbsp;ρ) from
the prefixing (ρ&nbsp;+&nbsp;R), and from the affixing (ρ&nbsp;+ R
+&nbsp;ρ) languages.</p>

<p>A fourth class, the infixing or incapsulating languages, are but a
variety of the affixing class, for what in Bask or in the polysynthetic
dialects of America has the appearance of actual insertion of formative
elements into the body of a base can be explained more rationally by the
former existence of simpler bases to which modifying suffixes or
prefixes have once been added, but not so firmly as to exclude the
addition of new suffixes at the end of the base, instead of, as with us,
at the end of the compound. If we could say in Greek <span class =
"greek" title = "deik-mi-nu">δείκ-μι-νυ</span>, instead of <span class =
"greek" title = "deik-nu-mi">δείκ-νυ-μι</span>, or in Sanskrit <ins
class = "correction" title = "text has ‘yu-mi-na-g’ without italics"><em>yu-mi-na-j</em></ins>, instead of <em>yu-na-j-mi</em>, we
should have a real beginning of so-called incapsulating formations.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_9" id = "tagII_9" href =
"#noteII_9">9</a></p>

<p>A few instances will place the normal progress of language from
stratum to stratum more clearly before our eyes. We have seen that in
Chinese every word is monosyllabic, every word tells, and there are, as
yet, no suffixes by which one word is derived from another, no
case-terminations by which the relation
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
<a name = "page86" id = "page86"> </a>
of one word to another could be indicated. How, then, does Chinese
distinguish between the son of the father, and the father of the son?
Simply by position. <i>Fú</i> is father, <i>tzé</i>, son; therefore
<i>fú tzé</i> is son of the father, <i>tzé fú</i>, father of the son.
This rule admits of no exception but one. If a Chinese wants to say <i>a
wine-glass</i>, he puts <i>wine</i> first and <i>glass</i> last, as in
English. If he wants to say <i>a glass of wine</i>, he puts <i>glass</i>
first and <i>wine</i> last. Thus <i>i-pei thsieou</i>, a cup of wine;
<i>thsieou pei</i>, a wine-cup. If, however, it seems desirable to mark
the word which is in the genitive more distinctly, the word <i>tchi</i>
may be placed after it, and we may say, <i>fú tchi tzé</i>, the son of
the father. In the Mandarin dialect this <i>tchi</i> has become
<i>ti</i>, and is added so constantly to the governed word, that, to all
intents and purposes, it may be treated as what we call the termination
of the genitive. Originally this <i>tchi</i> was a relative, or rather a
demonstrative, pronoun, and it continues to be used as such in the
ancient Chinese.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_10" id = "tagII_10" href
= "#noteII_10">10</a></p>

<p>It is perfectly true that Chinese possesses no derivative suffixes;
that it cannot derive, for instance, <i>kingly</i> from a noun, such as
<i>king</i>, or adjectives like <i>visible</i> and <i>invisible</i> from
a verb <i>videre</i>, to see. Yet the same idea which we express by
invisible, is expressed without difficulty in Chinese, only in a
different way. They say <i>khan-pu-kien</i>, “I-behold-and-do-not-see,”
and this to them conveys the same idea as the English <i>invisible</i>,
though more exactly <i>invisible</i> might be rendered by <i>kien</i>,
to see, <i>pou-te</i>, one cannot, <i>tí</i>, which.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<a name = "page87" id = "page87"> </a>
<p>We cannot in Chinese derive from <i>ferrum</i>, iron, a new
substantive <i>ferrarius</i>, a man who works in iron,
a&nbsp;blacksmith; <i>ferraria</i>, an iron mine, and again
<i>ferrariarius</i>, a man who works in an iron mine. All this is
possible in an inflectional language only. But it is not to be supposed
that in Chinese there is an independent expression for every single
conception, even for those which are clearly secondary and derivative.
If an arrow in Chinese is <i>shi</i>, then a maker of arrows
(in&nbsp;old French <i>fléchier</i>, in English <i>fletcher</i>) is
called an arrow-man, <i>shi-jin</i>. <i>Shui</i> means water, <i>fu</i>,
man; hence <i>shui-fu</i>, a water man, a&nbsp;water carrier. The same
word <i>shui</i>, water, if followed by <i>sheu</i>, hand, stands for
steersman, literally, water-hand. <i>Kin</i> means gold, <i>tsiang</i>,
maker; hence <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘kin-stiang’"><i>kin-tsiang</i></ins>, a&nbsp;goldsmith. <i>Shou</i>
means writing, <i>sheu</i>, hand; hence <i>shou-sheu</i>, a writer,
a&nbsp;copyist, literally, a&nbsp;writing-hand.</p>

<p>A transition from such compounds to really combinatory speech is
extremely easy. Let <i>sheu</i>, in the sense of hand, become obsolete,
and be replaced in the ordinary language by another word for hand; and
let such names as <i>shu-sheu</i>, author, <i>shui-sheu</i>, boatsman,
be retained, and the people who speak this language will soon accustom
themselves to look upon <i>sheu</i> as a mere derivative, and use it by
a kind of false analogy, even where the original meaning of <i>sheu</i>,
hand, would not have been applicable.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_11"

<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
<a name = "page88" id = "page88"> </a>
<p>We can watch the same process even in comparatively modern languages.
In Anglo-Saxon, for instance, <i>hâd</i> means state, order. It is used
as an independent word, and continued to be so used as late as Spenser,
who <span class = "locked">wrote:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Cuddie, I wote thou kenst little good,</p>
<p>So vainly t’ advaunce thy headlesse hood.”</p>
</div>

<p>After a time, however, <i>hâd</i>, as an independent word, was lost,
and its place taken by more classical expressions, such as <i>habit</i>,
<i>nature</i>, or <i>disposition</i>. But there remained such compounds
as <i>man-hâd</i>, the state of man, <i>God-hâd</i>, the nature of God;
and in these words the last element, being an empty word and no longer
understood, was soon looked upon as a mere suffix. Having lost its
vitality, it was all the more exposed to phonetic decay, and became both
<i>hood</i> and <i>head</i>.</p>

<p>Or, let us take another instance, The name given to the fox in
ancient German poetry was <i>Regin-hart</i>. <i>Regin</i> in Old High
German means thought or cunning, <i>hart</i>, the Gothic <i>hardu</i>,
means strong. This <i>hart</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagII_12" id =
"tagII_12" href = "#noteII_12">12</a> corresponds to the Greek <span
class = "greek" title = "kratos">κράτος</span>, which, in its adjectival
form of <span class = "greek" title = "kratês">κρατης</span>, forms as
many proper names in Greek as <i>hart</i> in German. In Sanskrit the
same word exists as <i>kratu</i>, meaning intellectual rather than
bodily strength, a&nbsp;shade of meaning which is still perceivable even
in the German <i>hart</i>, and in the English <i>hard</i> and
<i>hardy</i>. <i>Reginhart</i>, therefore, was originally a compound,
meaning “thought-strong,” strong in cunning. Other words formed in the
same
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<a name = "page89" id = "page89"> </a>
or a very similar manner are: <i>Peranhart</i> and <i>Bernhart</i>,
literally, bear-minded, or bold like a bear; <i>Eburhart</i>,
boar-minded; <i>Engil-hart</i>, angel-minded; <i>Gothart</i>,
god-minded; <i>Egin-hart</i>, fierce-minded; <i>Hugihart</i>,
wise-minded or strong in thought, the English <i>Hogarth</i>. In Low
German the second element, <i>hart</i>, lost its <i>h</i> and became
<i>ard</i>. This <i>ard</i> ceased to convey any definite meaning, and
though in some words which are formed by <i>ard</i> we may still
discover its original power, it soon became a mere derivative, and was
added promiscuously to form new words. In the Low German name for the
fox, <i>Reinaert</i>, neither the first nor the second word tells us any
longer anything, and the two words together have become a mere proper
name. In other words the first portion retains its meaning, but the
second, <i>ard</i>, is nothing but a suffix. Thus we find the Low German
<i>dronk-ard</i>, a drunkard; <i>dick-ard</i>, a thick fellow;
<i>rik-ard</i>, a rich fellow; <i>gêrard</i>, a miser. In English
<i>sweet-ard</i>, originally a very sweet person, has been changed and
resuscitated as <i>sweet-heart</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_13" id
= "tagII_13" href = "#noteII_13">13</a> by the same process which
changed <i>shamefast</i> into <i>shamefaced</i>.
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
<a name = "page90" id = "page90"> </a>
But, still more curious, this suffix <i>ard</i>, which had lost all life
and meaning in Low German, was taken over as a convenient derivative by
the Romance languages. After having borrowed a number of words such as
<i>renard</i>, fox, and proper names like <i>Bernard</i>,
<i>Richard</i>, <i>Gerard</i>, the framers of the new Romance dialects
used the same termination even at the end of Latin words. Thus they
formed not only many proper names, like <i>Abeillard</i>, <i>Bayard</i>,
<i>Brossard</i>, but appellatives like <i>leccardo</i>, a gourmand,
<i>linguardo</i>, a talker, <i>criard</i>, a crier, <i>codardo</i>,
Prov. <i>coart</i>, Fr. <i>couard</i>, a coward.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_14" id = "tagII_14" href = "#noteII_14">14</a> That a German word
<i>hart</i>, meaning strong, and originally strength, should become a
Roman suffix may seem strange; yet we no longer hesitate to use even
Hindustani words as English suffixes. In Hindustani <em>válá</em> is
used to form many substantives. If <em>Dilli</em> is Delhi, then
<em>Dill-vállá</em> is a man of Delhi. <em>Go</em> is cow,
<em>go-válá</em> a cow-herd, contracted into <em>gválá</em>. Innumerable
words can thus be formed, and as the derivative seemed handy and useful,
it was at last added even to English words, for instance in “Competition
wallah.”</p>

<p>These may seem isolated cases, but the principles on which they rest
pervade the whole structure of language. It is surprising to see how
much may be achieved by an application of those principles, how large
results may be obtained by the smallest and simplest means. By means of
the single radical î or <em>yâ</em> (originally <em>ya</em>), which in
the Aryan languages means to go or to send, the almost unconscious
framers of Aryan grammar formed not only their neuter, denominative, and
causative verbs, but their passives, their
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
<a name = "page91" id = "page91"> </a>
optatives, their futures, and a considerable number of substantives and
adjectives. Every one of these formations, in Sanskrit as well as in
Greek, can be explained, and has been explained, as the result of a
combination between any given verbal root and the radical <i>î</i> or
<em>yâ</em>.</p>

<p>There is, for instance, a root <em>nak</em>, expressive of perishing
or destruction. We have it in <em>nak</em>, night; Latin <i>nox</i>,
Greek <span class = "greek" title = "nux">νύξ</span>, meaning originally
the waning, the disappearing, the death of day. We have the same root in
composition, as, for instance, <em>jîva-nak</em>, life-destroying; and
by means of suffixes Greek has formed from it <span class = "greek"
title = "nek-ros">νεκ-ρός</span>, a&nbsp;dead body, <span class =
"greek" title = "nek-us">νέκ-υς</span>, dead, and <span class = "greek"
title = "nek-u-es">νέκ-υ-ες</span> in the plural, the departed. In
Sanskrit this root is turned into a simple verb, <em>naś-a-ti</em>, he
perishes. But in order to give to it a more distinctly neuter meaning,
a&nbsp;new verbal base is formed by composition with <em>ya</em>,
<em>naś-ya-ti</em>, he goes to destruction, he perishes.</p>

<p>By the same or a very similar process denominative verbs are formed
in Sanskrit to a very large extent. From <em>râjan</em>, king, we form
<em>râjâ-ya-te</em>, he behaves like a king, literally, he goes the
king, he acts the king, <i>il a l’allure d’un roi</i>. From
<em>kumârî</em>, girl, <em>kûmârâ-ya-te</em>, he behaves like a girl,
etc.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_15" id = "tagII_15" href =
"#noteII_15">15</a></p>

<p>After raising <em>naś</em> to <em>nâśa</em>, and adding the same
radical <em>ya</em>, Sanskrit produces a causative verb,
<em>nâśa-ya-ti</em>, he sends to destruction, the Latin
<i>nêcare</i>.</p>

<p>In close analogy to the neuter verb <em>naśyati</em>, the regular
passive is formed in Sanskrit by composition with <em>ya</em>, but by
adding, at the same time, a&nbsp;different
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
<a name = "page92" id = "page92"> </a>
set of personal terminations. Thus <em>náś-yá-ti</em> means he perishes,
while <em>naś-yá-te</em> means he is destroyed.</p>

<p>A verbal form of very frequent occurrence in Sanskrit is the
so-called gerundive participle which signifies that a thing is necessary
or proper to be done. Thus from <em>budh</em>, to know, is formed
<em>bodh-ya-s</em>, one who is to be known, <i>cognoscendus</i>; from
<em>guh</em>, to hide, <em>gúh-ya-s</em>, or <em>goh-ya-s</em>, one who
is to be hidden, literally, one who goes to a state of hiding or being
hidden; from <em>yaj</em>, to sacrifice, <em>yâj-ya-s</em>, one who is
or ought to be worshipped. Here, again, what is going to be becomes
gradually what will be, and lastly, what shall be. In Greek we find but
few analogous forms, such as <span class = "greek" title =
"hagios">ἅγιος</span>, holy, <span class = "greek" title =
"stug-i-os">στύγ-ι-ος</span>, to be hated; in Latin <i>ex-im-i-us</i>,
to be taken out; in Gothic <i>anda-nêm-ja</i>, to be taken on, to be
accepted, agreeable, German <i>angenehm</i>.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_22" id = "tagII_22" href = "#noteII_22">22</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
<a name = "page95" id = "page95"> </a>
<p>While the gerundive participles in <em>ya</em> are formed on the same
principle as the verbal bases in <em>ya</em> of the passive,
a&nbsp;number of substantives in <em>ya</em> seem to have been formed in
close analogy to the bases of denominative verbs, or the bases of neuter
verbs, in all of which the derivative <em>ya</em> expresses originally
the act of going, behaving, and at last of simple being. Thus from
<em>vid</em>, to know, we find in Sanskrit <em>vid-yâ</em>, knowing,
knowledge; from <em>śi</em>, to lie down, <em>śayyâ</em>; resting.
Analogous forms in Latin are <i>gaud-i-um</i>, <i>stud-i-um</i>, or with
feminine terminations, <i>in-ed-i-a</i>, <i>in-vid-i-a</i>,
<i>per-nic-i-es</i>, <i>scab-i-es</i>; in Greek, <span class = "greek"
title = "man-i-a, hamart-i-a">μαν-ί-α, ἁμαρτ-ί-α</span>, or <span class
= "greek" title = "hamart-i-on">ἁμάρτ-ι-ον</span>; in German, numerous
abstract nouns in <i>i</i> and <i>e</i>.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_23" id = "tagII_23" href = "#noteII_23">23</a></p>

<p>This shows how much can be achieved, and has been achieved, in
language with the simplest materials. Neuter, denominative, causative,
passive verbs, optatives and futures, gerundives, adjectives, and
substantives, all are formed by one and the same process, by means of
one and the same root. It is no inconsiderable portion of grammar which
has thus been explained by this one root <em>ya</em>, to go, and we
learn again and again how simple and yet how wonderful are the ways of
language, if we follow them up from stratum to stratum to their original
starting-point.</p>

<p>Now what has happened in these cases, has happened over and over
again in the history of language. Everything that is now formal, not
only derivative suffixes, but everything that constitutes the
grammatical
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<a name = "page96" id = "page96"> </a>
framework and articulation of language, was originally material. What we
now call the terminations of cases were mostly local adverbs; what we
call the personal endings of verbs were personal pronouns. Suffixes and
affixes were mostly independent words, nominal, verbal, or pronominal;
there is, in fact, nothing in language that is now empty, or dead, or
formal, that was not originally full, and alive, and material. It is the
object of Comparative Grammar to trace every formal or dead element back
to its life-like form; and though this resuscitating process is by no
means complete, nay, though in several cases it seems hopeless to try to
discover the living type from which proceeded the petrified fragments
which we call terminations or suffixes, enough evidence has been brought
together to establish on the firmest basis this general maxim, that
<i>Nothing is dead in any language that was not originally alive</i>;
that nothing exists in a tertiary stratum that does not find its
antecedents and its explanation in the secondary or primary stratum of
human speech.</p>

<p>After having explained, as far as it was possible in so short a time,
what I consider to be the right view of the stratification of human
speech, I&nbsp;should have wished to be able to show to you how the
aspect of some of the most difficult and most interesting problems of
our science is changed, if we look at them again with the new light
which we have gained regarding the necessary antecedents of all
language. Let me only call your attention to one of the most contested
points in the Science of Language. The question whether we may assign a
common origin to the Aryan and Semitic languages has been discussed over
and over again. No one thinks now of deriving
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
<a name = "page97" id = "page97"> </a>
Sanskrit from Hebrew, or Hebrew from Sanskrit; the only question is
whether at some time or other the two languages could ever have formed
part of one and the same body of speech. There are scholars, and very
eminent scholars, who deny all similarity between the two, while others
have collected materials that would seem to make it difficult to assign
such numerous coincidences to mere chance. Nowhere, in fact, has Bacon’s
observation on this radical distinction between different men’s
dispositions for philosophy and the sciences been more fully verified
than among the students of the Science of Language:&mdash;<i>Maximum et
velut radicale discrimen ingeniorum, quoad philosophiam et scientias,
illud est, quod alia ingenia sint fortiora et aptiora ad notandas rerum
differentias; alia ad notandas rerum similitudines.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.
.&nbsp;. Utrumque autem ingenium facile labitur in excessum, prensando
aut gradus rerum, aut umbras.</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagII_24" id =
"tagII_24" href = "#noteII_24">24</a> Before, however, we enter upon an
examination of the evidence brought forward by different scholars in
support of their conflicting theories, it is our first duty to ask a
preliminary question, viz.: What kind of evidence have we any right to
expect, considering that both Sanskrit and Hebrew belong, in the state
in which we know them, to the inflectional stratum of speech?</p>

<p>Now it is quite true that Sanskrit and Hebrew had a separate
existence long before they reached the tertiary stratum, before they
became thoroughly inflectional; and that consequently they can share
nothing in common that is peculiar to the inflectional stratum in each,
nothing that is the result of phonetic decay, which sets in after
combinatory formations have become
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
<a name = "page98" id = "page98"> </a>
unintelligible and traditional. I&nbsp;mean, supposing that the pronoun
of the first person had been originally the same in the Semitic and
Aryan languages, supposing that in the Hebrew <i>an-oki</i> (Assyrian
<i>an-aku</i>, Phen. <i>anak</i>) the last portion, <i>oki</i>, was
originally identical with the Sanskrit <em>ah</em> in <em>aham</em>, the
Greek <span class = "greek" title = "eg">ἐγ</span> in <span class =
"greek" title = "eg-ô">ἐγ-ώ</span>, it would still be useless to attempt
to derive the termination of the first person singular, whether in
<i>kâtal-ti</i> or in <i>ektôl</i>, from the same type which in Sanskrit
appears as <em>mi</em> or <em>am</em> or <em>a</em>, in
<em>tudâ-mi</em>, <em>atud-am</em>, <em>tutod-a</em>. There cannot be
between Hebrew and Sanskrit the same relationship as between Sanskrit
and Greek, if indeed the term of relationship is applicable even to
Sanskrit and Greek, which are really mere dialectic varieties of one and
the same type of speech.</p>

<p>The question then arises, Could the Semitic and Aryan languages have
been identical during the second or <i>combinatory</i> period? Here, as
before, the answer must be, I&nbsp;believe, decidedly negative, for not
only are the empty words which are used for derivative purposes
different in each, but, what is far more characteristic, the manner in
which they are added to the stems is different too. In the Aryan
languages formative elements are attached to the ends of words only; in
the Semitic languages they are found both at the end and at the
beginning. In the Aryan languages grammatical compounds are all
according to the formula rρ; in the Semitic we have formations after the
formulas rρ, ρr, and ρrρ.</p>

<p>There remains, therefore, the first or isolating stage only in which
Semitic and Aryan speech might have been identical. But even here we
must make a distinction. All Aryan roots are monosyllabic, all Semitic
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
<a name = "page99" id = "page99"> </a>
roots have been raised to triliteral form. Therefore it is only previous
to the time when the Semitic roots assumed this secondary triliteral
form that any community could possibly be admitted between these two
streams of language. Supposing we knew as an historical fact that at
this early period&mdash;a period which transcends the limits of
everything we are accustomed to call historical&mdash;Semitic and Aryan
speech had been identical, what evidence of this union could we expect
to find in the actual Semitic and Aryan languages such as we know them
in their inflectional period? Let us recollect that the 100,000 words of
English, nay, the many hundred thousand words in all the dictionaries of
the other Aryan languages, have been reduced to about 500 roots, and
that this small number of roots admits of still further reduction. Let
us, then, bear in mind that the same holds good with regard to the
Semitic languages, particularly if we accept the reduction of all
triliteral to biliteral roots. What, then, could we expect in our
comparison of Hebrew and Sanskrit but a small number of radical
coincidences, a&nbsp;similarity in the form and meaning of about 500
radical syllables, everything else in Hebrew and Sanskrit being an
after-growth, which could not begin before the two branches of speech
were severed once and forever.</p>

<p>But more, if we look at these roots we shall find that their
predicative power is throughout very general, and therefore liable to an
infinite amount of specification. A&nbsp;root that means to fall
(Sk.&nbsp;<em>pat</em>, <span class = "greek" title =
"pi-pt-ô">πί-πτ-ω</span>) comes to mean to fly
(Sk.&nbsp;<em>ut-pat</em>, <span class = "greek" title =
"petomai">πέτομαι</span>). The root <em>dâ</em>, which means to give,
assumes, after the preposition â, the sense of taking. The root
<em>yu</em>, which means to join, means to separate if preceded
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
<a name = "page100" id = "page100"> </a>
by the preposition <em>vi</em>. The root <em>ghar</em>, which expresses
brightness, may supply, and does supply in different Aryan languages,
derivations expressive of brightness (gleam), warmth
(Sk.&nbsp;<em>gharma</em>, heat), joy (<span class = "greek" title =
"chairein">χαίρειν</span>), love (<span class = "greek" title =
"charis">χάρις</span>), of the colors of green (Sk.&nbsp;<em>hari</em>),
yellow (<i>gilvus</i>, <i>flavus</i>), and red (Sk.&nbsp;<em>harit</em>,
<i>fulvus</i>), and of the conception of growing (<i>ger-men</i>). In
the Semitic languages this vagueness of meaning in the radical elements
forms one of the principal difficulties of the student, for according as
a root is used in its different conjugations, it may convey the most
startling variety of conception. It is also to be taken into account
that out of the very limited number of roots which at that early time
were used in common by the ancestors of the Aryan and Semitic races,
a&nbsp;certain portion may have been lost by each, so that the fact that
there are roots in Hebrew of which no trace exists in Sanskrit, and
<i>vice versâ</i>, would again be perfectly natural and
intelligible.</p>

<p>It is right and most essential that we should see all this clearly,
that we should understand how little evidence we are justified in
expecting in support of a common origin of the Semitic and Aryan
languages, before we commit ourselves to any opinion on this important
subject. I&nbsp;have by no means exhausted all the influences that would
naturally, nay necessarily, have contributed towards producing the
differences between the radical elements of Aryan and Semitic speech,
always supposing that the two sprang originally from the same source.
Even if we excluded the ravages of phonetic decay from that early period
of speech, we should have to make ample allowances for the influence of
dialectic variety. We know in the Aryan languages the constant play
between gutturals,
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<a name = "page101" id = "page101"> </a>
dentals, and labials (<i>quinque</i>, Sk. <em>panca</em>, <span class =
"greek" title = "pente">πέντε</span>, Æol. <span class = "greek" title =
"pempe">πέμπε</span>, Goth. <i>fimf</i>). We know the dialectic
interchange of Aspirate, Media, and Tenuis, which, from the very
beginning, has imparted to the principal channels of Aryan speech their
individual character (<span class = "greek" title =
"treis">τρεῖς</span>, Goth. <i>threis</i>, High German <i>drei</i>).<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_25" id = "tagII_25" href =
"#noteII_25">25</a> If this and much more could happen within the
dialectic limits of one more or less settled body of speech, what must
have been the chances beyond those limits? Considering how fatal to the
identity of a word the change of a single consonant would be in
monosyllabic languages, we might expect that monosyllabic roots, if
their meaning was so general, vague, and changeable, would all the more
carefully have preserved their consonantal outline. But this is by no
means the case. Monosyllabic languages have their dialects no less than
polysyllabic ones; and from the
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
<a name = "page102" id = "page102"> </a>
rapid and decisive divergence of such dialects, we may learn how rapid
and decisive the divergence of language must have been during the
isolating period. Mr. Edkins, who has paid particular attention to the
dialects of Chinese, states that in the northern provinces the greatest
changes have taken place, eight initial and one final consonant having
been exchanged for others, and three finals lost. Along the southern
bank of the Yang-tsï-kiang, and a little to the north of it, the old
initials are all preserved, as also through Chekiang to Fuh-kien. But
among the finals, <i>m</i> is exchanged for <i>n</i>; <i>t</i> and
<i>p</i> are lost, and also <i>k</i>, except in some country districts.
Some words have two forms, one used colloquially, and one appropriated
to reading. The former is the older pronunciation, and the latter more
near to Mandarin. The cities of Su-cheu, Hang-cheu, Ningpo, and
When-cheu, with the surrounding country, may be considered as having one
dialect, spoken probably by thirty millions of people, <i>i.e.</i>, by
more than the whole population of Great Britain and Ireland. The city of
Hwei-cheu has a dialect of its own, in which the soft initial consonants
are exchanged for hard and aspirated ones, a&nbsp;process analogous to
what we call <i>Lautverschiebung</i> in the Aryan languages. At
Fu-cheu-fu, in the eastern part of the province of Kiang-si, the soft
initials have likewise been replaced by aspirates. In many parts of the
province of Hunan the soft initials still linger on; but in the city of
Chang-sha the spoken dialect has the five tones of Mandarin, and the
aspirated and other initials distributed in the same manner. In the
island of Hai-nan there is a distinct approach to the form which Chinese
words assume in the language of Annam. Many of the hard consonants are
softened,
<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
<a name = "page103" id = "page103"> </a>
instead of the reverse taking place as in many other parts of China.
Thus <i>ti</i>, <i>di</i>, both <i>ti</i> in Mandarin, are both
pronounced <i>di</i> in Hai-nan. <i>B</i> and <i>p</i> are both used for
many words whose initials are <i>w</i> and <i>f</i> in Mandarin. In the
dialects of the province of Fuhkien the following changes take place in
initial consonants: <i>k</i> is used for <i>h</i>; <i>p</i> for
<i>f</i>; <i>m</i>, <i>b</i>, for <i>w</i>; <i>j</i> for <i>y</i>;
<i>t</i> for <i>ch</i>; <i>ch</i> for <i>s</i>; <i>ng</i> for <i>i</i>,
<i>y</i>, <i>w</i>; <i>n</i> for <i>j</i>.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_26" id = "tagII_26" href = "#noteII_26">26</a> When we have
clearly realized to ourselves what such changes mean in words consisting
of one consonant and one vowel, we shall be more competent to act as
judges, and to determine what right we have to call for more ample and
more definite evidence in support of the common origin of languages
which became separated during their monosyllabic or isolating stages,
and which are not known to us before they are well advanced in the
inflectional stage.</p>

<p>It might be said,&mdash;Why, if we make allowance for all this, the
evidence really comes to nothing, and is hardly deserving of the
attention of the scholar. I&nbsp;do not deny that this is, and always
has been my own opinion. All I wish to put clearly before other scholars
is, that this is not our fault. We see why there can be no evidence, and
we find there is no evidence, or very little support of a common origin
of Semitic and Aryan speech. But that is very different from dogmatic
assertions, so often and so confidently repeated, that there can be no
kind of relationship between Sanskrit and Hebrew, that they must have
had different beginnings, that they represent, in fact, two independent
species of human speech. All this is pure dogmatism, and no true scholar
will be satisfied with it, or turn away contemptuously
<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
<a name = "page104" id = "page104"> </a>
from the tentative researches of scholars like Ewald, Raumer, and
Ascoli. These scholars, particularly Raumer and Ascoli, have given us,
as far as I can judge, far more evidence in support of a radical
relationship between Hebrew and Sanskrit than, from my point of view, we
are entitled to expect. I&nbsp;mean this as a caution in both
directions. If, on one side, we ought not to demand more than we have a
right to demand, we ought, on the other, not to look for, nor attempt to
bring forward, more evidence than the nature of the case admits of. We
know that words which have identically the same sound and meaning in
Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and German, cannot be the same words, because
they would contravene those phonetic laws that made these languages to
differ from each other. <i>To doom</i> cannot have any connection with
the Latin <i>damnare</i>; <i>to call</i> cannot be the Greek <span class
= "greek" title = "kalein">καλεῖν</span>, the Latin <i>calare</i>; nor
Greek <span class = "greek" title = "phaulos">φαῦλος</span> the German
<i>faul</i>; the English <i>care</i> cannot be identified with Latin
<i>cura</i>, nor the German <i>Auge</i> with the Greek <span class =
"greek" title = "augê">αὐγή</span>. The same applies, only with a
hundred-fold greater force, to words in Hebrew and Sanskrit. If any
triliteral root in Hebrew were to agree with a triliteral word in
Sanskrit, we should feel certain, at once, that they are not the same,
or that their similarity is purely accidental. Pronouns, numerals, and a
few imitative rather than predicative names for father and mother, etc.,
may have been preserved from the earliest stage by the Aryan and Semitic
speakers; but if scholars go beyond, and compare such words as Hebrew
<i>barak</i>, to bless, and Latin <i>precari</i>; Hebrew <i>lab</i>,
heart, and the English <i>liver</i>; Hebrew <i>melech</i>, king, and the
Latin <i>mulcere</i>, to smoothe, to quiet, to subdue, they are in great
danger, I&nbsp;believe, of proving too much.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<a name = "page105" id = "page105"> </a>
<p>Attempts have lately been made to point out a number of roots which
Chinese shares in common with Sanskrit. Far be it from me to stigmatize
even such researches as unscientific, though it requires an effort for
one brought up in the very straitest school of Bopp, to approach such
inquiries without prejudice. Yet, if conducted with care and sobriety,
and particularly with a clear perception of the limits within which such
inquiries must be confined, they are perfectly legitimate; far more so
than the learned dogmatism with which some of our most eminent scholars
have declared a common origin of Sanskrit and Chinese as out of the
question. I&nbsp;cannot bring myself to say that the method which Mr.
Chalmers adopts in his interesting work on the “Origin of Chinese” is
likely to carry conviction to the mind of the <i>bonà fide</i> skeptic.
I&nbsp;believe, before we compare the words of Chinese with those of any
other language, every effort should be made to trace Chinese words back
to their most primitive form. Here Mr. Edkins has pointed out the road
that ought to be followed, and has clearly shown the great advantage to
be derived from an accurate study of Chinese dialects. The same scholar
has done still more by pointing out how Chinese should at first be
compared with its nearest relatives, the Mongolian of the
North-Turanian, and the Tibetan of the South-Turanian class, before any
comparisons are attempted with more distant colonies that started during
the monosyllabic period of speech. “I&nbsp;am now seeking to compare,”
he writes, “the Mongolian and Tibetan with the Chinese, and have already
obtained some interesting <span class =
"locked">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“1. A large proportion of Mongol words are Chinese. Perhaps a fifth
are so. The identity is in the
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<a name = "page106" id = "page106"> </a>
first syllable of the Mongol words, that being the root. The
correspondence is most striking in the adjectives, of which perhaps one
half of the most common are the same radically as in Chinese; e.g.,
<i>sain</i>, good; <i>begen</i>, low; <i>ic‘hi</i>, right;
<i>sologai</i>, left; <i>c‘hihe</i>, straight; <i>gadan</i>, outside;
<i>c’hohon</i>, few; <i>logon</i>, green; <i>hung-gun</i>, light (not
heavy). But the identity is also extensive in other parts of speech, and
this identity of common roots seems to extend into the Turkish, Tatar,
etc.; e.g., <i>su</i>, water; <i>tenri</i>, heaven.</p>

<p>“2. To compare Mongol with Chinese it is necessary to go back at
least six centuries in the development of the Chinese language. For we
find in common roots final letters peculiar to the old Chinese,
<i>e.g.</i>, final <i>m</i>. The initial letters also need to be
considered from another standpoint than the Mandarin pronunciation. If a
large number of words are common to Chinese, Mongol, and Tatar, we must
go back at least twelve centuries to obtain a convenient epoch of
comparison.</p>

<p>“3. While the Mongol has no traces of tones, they are very distinctly
developed in Tibetan. Csoma de Körös and Schmidt do not mention the
existence of tones, but they plainly occur in the pronunciation of
native Tibetans resident in Peking.</p>

<p>“4. As in the case of the comparison with Mongol, it is necessary in
examining the connection of Tibetan with Chinese to adopt the old form
of the Chinese with its more numerous final consonants, and its full
system of soft, hard, and aspirated initials. The Tibetan numerals
exemplify this with sufficient clearness.</p>

<p>“5. While the Mongol is near the Chinese in the
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
<a name = "page107" id = "page107"> </a>
extensive prevalence of words common to the two languages, the Tibetan
is near in phonal structure, as being tonic and monosyllabic. This being
so, it is less remarkable that there are many words common to Chinese
and Tibetan, for it might have been expected; but that there should be
perhaps as many in the Mongol with its long untoned polysyllables, is a
curious circumstance.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_27" id = "tagII_27"
href = "#noteII_27">27</a>

<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<a name = "page108" id = "page108"> </a>
<p>This is no doubt the right spirit in which researches into the early
history of language should be
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
<a name = "page109" id = "page109"> </a>
conducted, and I hope that Mr. Edkins, Mr. Chalmers, and others, will
not allow themselves to be discouraged by the ordinary objections that
are brought against all tentative studies. Even if their researches
should only lead to negative results, they would be of the highest
importance. The criterion by which we test the relationship of
inflectional languages, such as Sanskrit and Greek, Hebrew and Arabic,
cannot, from the nature of the case, be applied to languages which are
still in the combinatory or isolating stratum, nor would they answer any
purpose, if we tried by them to determine whether certain languages,
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
<a name = "page110" id = "page110"> </a>
separated during their inflectional growth, had been united during their
combinatory stage, or whether languages, separated during their
combinatory progress, had started from a common centre in their
monosyllabic age. Bopp’s attempt to work with his Aryan tools on the
Malayo-Polynesian languages, and to discover in them traces of Aryan
forms, ought to serve as a warning example.</p>

<p>However, there are dangers also, and even greater dangers, on the
opposite shore, and if Mr. Chalmers in his interesting work on “the
Origin of Chinese,” compares, for instance, the Chinese <i>tzé</i>,
child, with the Bohemian <i>tsi</i>, daughter, I&nbsp;know that the
indignation of the Aryan scholars will be roused to a very high pitch,
considering how they have proved most minutely that <i>tsi</i> or
<i>dci</i> in Bohemian is the regular modification of <i>dugte</i>, and
that <i>dugte</i> is the Sanskrit <em>duhitar</em>, the Greek <span
class = "greek" title = "thugatêr">θυγάτηρ</span>, daughter, originally
a pet-name, meaning a milk-maid, and given by the Aryan shepherds, and
by them only, to the daughters of their house. Such accidents<a class =
"tag" name = "tagII_28" id = "tagII_28" href = "#noteII_28">28</a> will
happen in so comprehensive a subject as the Science of Language. They
have happened to scholars like Bopp, Grimm, and Burnouf, and they will
happen again. I&nbsp;do not defend haste or inaccuracy, I&nbsp;only say,
we must venture on, and not imagine that all is done, and that nothing
remains to conquer in our science. Our watchword, here as elsewhere,
should be Festina lente! but, by all means, Festina! Festina!
Festina!</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> a former Lecture on the
“Stratification of Language” I ventured to assert that wherever
<i>inflection</i> has yielded to a rational analysis, it has invariably
been recognized as the result of a previous <i>combination</i>, and
wherever <i>combination</i> has been traced back to an earlier stage,
that earlier stage has been simply <i>juxtaposition</i>.</p>

<p>Professor Pott in his “Etymologische Forschungen” (1871, p. 16),
a&nbsp;work which worthily holds its place by the side of Bopp’s
“Comparative Grammar,” questions the correctness of that statement; but
in doing so he seems to me to have overlooked the restrictions which I
myself had introduced, in order to avoid the danger of committing myself
to what might seem too general a statement. I&nbsp;did not say that
every form of inflection had been proved to spring from a previous
combination, but I spoke of those cases only where we have succeeded in
a rational analysis of inflectional forms, and it was in these that I
maintained that inflection had always been found to be the result of
previous combination. What is the object of the analysis of grammatical
inflections, or of Comparative Grammar in general, if not to find out
what terminations originally were, before they had assumed a purely
formal character? If we take the French adverb <i>sincèrement</i>,
sincerely, and trace it
<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<a name = "page112" id = "page112"> </a>
back to the Latin <i>sincerâ mente</i>, we have for a second time the
three stages of juxtaposition, combination, and, to a certain extent,
inflection, repeated before our eyes. I&nbsp;say, inflection, for
<i>ment</i>, though originally an independent word, soon becomes a mere
adverbial suffix, the speakers so little thinking of its original
purport, that we may say of a stone that it falls <i>lourdement</i>,
heavily, without wishing to imply that it falls <i>luridâ mente</i>,
with a heavy, lit., with a lurid mind.</p>

<p>If we take the nom. sing. of a noun in Sanskrit, Greek, or Latin, we
find that masculine nouns end frequently in <i>s</i>. We have for
instance, Sk. <em>veśa-s</em><ins class = "correction" title = ", missing">, </ins>Gr. <span class = "greek" title =
"oiko-s">οἶκο-ς</span>, Lat. <i>vîcu-s</i>. These three words are
identical in their termination, in their base, and in their root. The
root is the Sk. <em>viś</em>, to settle down, to enter upon or into a
thing. This root, without undergoing any further change, may answer the
purpose both of a verbal and a nominal base. In the precative, for
instance, we have <em>viś-yâ-t</em>, he may enter, which yields to a
rational analysis into <em>viś</em>, the root <em>yâ</em>, to go, and
the old pronominal stem of the third person, <i>t</i>, he. We
reduplicate the root, and we get the perfect <em>vi-viś-us</em>, they
have entered. Here I can understand that objections might be raised
against accepting us as a mere phonetic corruption of <em>ant</em> and
<em>anti</em>; but if, as in Greek, we find as the termination of the
third pers. plur. of the perfect <span class = "greek" title =
"asi">ᾶσι</span>, we know that this is a merely phonetic change of the
original <em>anti</em>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_29" id =
"tagII_29" href = "#noteII_29">29</a> and this <em>anti</em> has been
traced back by Pott himself (whether rightly or wrongly, we need not
here inquire) to the pronominal stems <em>ana</em>, that, and
<em>ti</em>, he. These two stems, when joined together,
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
<a name = "page113" id = "page113"> </a>
become <em>anti</em>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_30" id = "tagII_30"
href = "#noteII_30">30</a> meaning <i>those</i> and <i>he</i>, and are
gradually reduced to <span class = "greek" title = "asi">ᾶσι</span>, and
in Sanskrit to <em>us</em> for <em>ant</em>. What we call reduplication
has likewise been traced back by Pott himself to an original repetition
of the whole root, so that <em>vi-viś</em> stands for an original or
intentional <em>viś-viś</em>; thus showing again the succession of the
three stages, juxtaposition, <em>viś-viś</em>, combination
<em>vi-viś</em>, inflection, the same, <em>vi-viś</em>, though liable to
further phonetic modification.</p>

<p>Used as a nominal base the same root <em>viś</em> appears, without
any change, in the nom. plur. <em>viś-as</em>, the settlers, the clans,
the people. Now here again Professor Pott himself has endeavored to
explain the inflection <em>as</em> by tracing it back to the pronominal
base <em>as</em>, in <em>asau</em>, <i>ille</i>. He therefore takes the
plural <em>viś-as</em> as a compound, meaning “man and that;” that is to
say, he traces the inflection back to a combinatory origin.</p>

<p>By raising the simple base <em>viś</em> to <em>viśa</em>, we arrive
at new verbal forms, such as <em>viś-â-mi</em>, I enter,
<em>viś-a-si</em>, thou enterest, <em>viś-a-ti</em>, he enters. In all
these inflectional forms, the antecedent combinatory stage is still more
or less visible, for <em>mi</em>, <em>si</em>, <em>ti</em>, whatever
their exact history may have been, are clearly varieties of the
pronominal bases of the first, second, and third persons, <em>ma</em>,
<em>tva</em>, <em>ta</em>.</p>

<p>Lastly, by raising <em>viś</em> to <em>veśa</em>, we arrive at a new
nominal base, and by adding to it the stem of a demonstrative pronoun
<i>s</i>, we form the so-called nom. sing. <em>veśa-s</em>, <span class
= "greek" title = "oiko-s">οἶκο-ς</span>, <i>vicu-s</i>, from which we
started, meaning originally house-here, this house, the house.</p>

<p>In all this Professor Pott would fully agree, but where he would
differ, would be when we proceed to
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<a name = "page114" id = "page114"> </a>
generalize, and to lay it down as an axiom, that all inflectional forms
<i>must</i> have had the same combinatory origin. He may be right in
thus guarding against too hasty generalization, to which we are but too
prone in all inductive sciences. I&nbsp;am well aware that there are
many inflections which have not yielded, as yet, to any rational
analysis, but, with that reservation, I&nbsp;thought, and I still think,
it right to say that, until some other process of forming those
inflections has been pointed out, inflection may be considered as the
invariable result of combination.</p>

<p>It is impossible in writing, always to repeat such qualifications and
reservations. They must be taken as understood. Take for instance the
augment in Greek and Sanskrit. Some scholars have explained it as a
negative particle, others as a demonstrative pronoun; others, again,
took it as a mere symbol of differentiation. If the last explanation
could be established by more general analogies, then, no doubt, we
should have here an inflection, that cannot be referred to combination.
Again, it would be difficult to say, what independent element was added
to the pronoun <em>sa</em>, he, in order to make it sâ, she. This, too,
may, for all we know, be a case of phonetic symbolism, and, if so, it
should be treated on its own merits. The lengthening of the vowel in the
subjunctive mood was formerly represented by Professor Curtius as a
symbolic expression of hesitation, but he has lately recalled that
explanation as untenable. I&nbsp;pointed out that when in Hebrew we meet
with such forms as <i>Piel</i> and <i>Pual</i>, <i>Hiphil</i> and
<i>Hophal</i>, we feel tempted to admit formative agencies, different
from mere juxtaposition and combination. But before we admit this purely
phonetic symbolism, we
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
<a name = "page115" id = "page115"> </a>
should bear in mind that the changes of <i>bruder</i>, brother, into
<i>brüder</i>, brethren, of <i>Ich weiss</i>, I know, into <i>wir
wissen</i>, we know, which seem at first sight purely phonetic, have
after all been proved to be the indirect result of juxtaposition and
combination, so that we ought to be extremely careful and first exhaust
every possible rational explanation, before we have recourse to phonetic
symbolism as an element in the production of inflection forms.</p>

<p>The chief object, however, of my lecture on the “Stratification of
Language” was not so much to show that inflection everywhere presupposes
combination, and combination juxtaposition, but rather to call attention
to a fact that had not been noticed before, viz.: that there is hardly
any language, which is not at the same time <i>isolating</i>,
<i>combinatory</i>, and <i>inflectional</i>.</p>

<p>It had been the custom in classifying languages morphologically to
represent some languages, for instance Chinese, as <i>isolating</i>;
others, such as Turkish or Finnish, as <i>combinatory</i>; others, such
as Sanskrit or Hebrew, as <i>inflectional</i>. Without contesting the
value of this classification for certain purposes, I&nbsp;pointed out
that even Chinese, the very type of the isolating class, is not free
from combinatory forms, and that the more highly developed among the
combinatory languages, such as Hungarian, Finnish, Tamil, etc., show the
clearest traces of incipient inflection. “The difficulty is not,” as I
said, “to show the transition of one stratum of speech into another, but
rather to draw a sharp line between the different strata. The same,
difficulty was felt in Geology, and led Sir Charles Lyell to invent such
pliant names as <i>Eocene</i>, <i>Meiocene</i>, and <i>Pleiocene</i>,
names which indicate a mere
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<a name = "page116" id = "page116"> </a>
dawn, a&nbsp;minority, or a majority of new formations, but do not draw
a fast and hard line, cutting off one stratum from the other. Natural
growth and even merely mechanical accumulation and accretion, here as
elsewhere, are so minute and almost imperceptible that they defy all
strict scientific terminology, and force upon us the lesson that we must
be satisfied with an approximate accuracy.”</p>

<p>Holding these opinions, and having established them by an amount of
evidence which, though it might easily be increased, seemed to me
sufficient, I&nbsp;did not think it safe to assign to the three stages
in the history of the Aryan languages, the <i>juxtapositional</i>, the
<i>combinatory</i>, and the <i>inflectional</i>, a strictly successive
character, still less to admit in the growth of the Aryan languages a
number of definite stages, which should be sharply separated from each
other, and assume an almost chronological character. I&nbsp;fully admit
that wherever <i>inflectional</i> forms in the Aryan languages have
yielded to a rational analysis, we see that they are preceded
chronologically by <i>combinatory</i> formations; nor should I deny for
one moment that <i>combinatory</i> forms presuppose an antecedent, and
therefore chronologically more ancient stage of mere juxtaposition. What
I doubt is whether, as soon as combination sets in, juxtaposition
ceases, and whether the first appearance of inflection puts an end to
the continued working of combination.</p>

<p>It seems to me, even if we argue only on <i>à priori</i> grounds,
that there must have been at least a period of transition during which
both principles were at work together, and I hardly can understand what
certain scholars mean if they represent the principle of inflection as a
sudden psychological change which,
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<a name = "page117" id = "page117"> </a>
as soon as it has taken place, makes a return to combination altogether
impossible. If, instead of arguing <i>à priori</i>, we look the facts of
language in the face, we cannot help seeing that, even after that period
during which it is supposed that the United Aryan language had attained
its full development, I&nbsp;mean at a time when Sanskrit, Greek, and
Latin had become completely separated, as so many national dialects,
each with its own fully developed inflectional grammar, the power of
combination was by no means extinct. The free power of composition,
which is so manifest in Sanskrit and Greek, testifies to the continued
working of combination in strictly historical times. I&nbsp;see no real
distinction between the transition of <i>Néa pólis</i>, i.e., new town,
into <i>Neápolis</i>, and into <i>Naples</i>, and the most primitive
combination in Chinese, and I maintain that as long as a language
retains that unbounded faculty of composition, which we see in Sanskrit,
in Greek, and in German, the growth of new inflectional forms from
combinatory germs must be admitted as possible. Forms such as the
passive aorist in Greek, <span class = "greek" title =
"etethên">ἐτέθην</span>, or the weak preterite in Gothic
<i>nas-i-da</i>, <i>nas-i-dédjau</i>, need not have been formed before
the Aryan family broke up into national languages; and forms such as
Italian <i>meco</i>, <i>fratelmo</i>, or the future <i>avro</i>, I shall
have, though not exactly of the same workmanship, show at all events
that analogous powers are at work even in the latest periods of
linguistic growth.</p>

<p>Holding these opinions, which, as far as I know, have never been
controverted, I&nbsp;ought perhaps, when I came to publish the preceding
Lecture, to have defended my position against the powerful arguments
advanced in the meantime by my old friend, Professor
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<a name = "page118" id = "page118"> </a>
G.&nbsp;Curtius, in support of a diametrically opposite opinion in his
classical essay, “On the Chronology of the Indo-Germanic Languages,”
published in 1867, new edition, 1873. While I had endeavored to show
that juxtaposition, combination, and inflection, though following each
other in succession, do not represent chronological periods, but
represent phases, strongly developed, it is true, in certain languages,
but extending their influence far beyond the limits commonly assigned to
them, Professor Curtius tried to establish the chronological character
not only of these three, but of four other phases or periods in the
history of Aryan speech. Confining himself to what he considers the
undivided Aryan language to have been, before it was broken up into
national dialects, such as Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, he proceeds to
subdivide the antecedent period of its growth into <i>seven</i> definite
stages, each marked by a definite character, and each representing a sum
of years in the chronology of the Aryan language. As I had found it
difficult to treat Chinese as entirely <i>juxtapositional</i>, or
Turkish as entirely <i>combinatory</i>, or Sanskrit as entirely
<i>inflectional</i>, it was perhaps not to be wondered at that not even
the persuasive pleading of my learned friend could convince me of the
truth of the more minute chronological division proposed by him in his
learned essay. But it would hardly have been fair if, on the present
occasion, I&nbsp;had reprinted my “Rede Lecture” without explaining why
I had altered nothing in my theory of linguistic growth, why I retained
these three phases and no more, and why I treated even these, not as
chronological periods, in the strict sense of the word, but as
preponderating tendencies, giving an individual character to certain
classes of language, without
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
<a name = "page119" id = "page119"> </a>
being totally absent in others. Professor Curtius is one of the few
scholars with whom it is pleasant to differ. He has shown again and
again that what he cares for is truth, not victory, and when he has
defended his position against attacks not always courteous, he has
invariably done so, not with hard words, but with hard arguments.
I&nbsp;therefore feel no hesitation in stating plainly to him where his
theories seem to me either not fully supported, or even contradicted by
the facts of language, and I trust that this free exchange of ideas,
though in public, will be as pleasant as our conversations in private
used to be, now more than thirty years ago.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the <i>First Period</i>, which Professor Curtius
calls the <i>Root-Period</i>. There must have been, as I tried to
explain before, a&nbsp;period for the Aryan languages, during which they
stood on a level with Chinese, using nothing but roots, or radical
words, without having reduced any of them to a purely formal character,
without having gone through the process of changing what Chinese
grammarians call <i>full</i> words into <i>empty</i> words. I&nbsp;have
always held, that to speak of roots as mere abstractions, as the result
of grammatical theory, is self-contradictory. Roots which never had any
real or historical existence may have been invented both in modern and
ancient collections or <em class = "sanskrit">Dhâtupâṭhas</em>; but that
is simply the fault of our etymological analysis, and in no way affects
the fact, that the Aryan, like all other languages we know, began with
roots. We may doubt the legitimacy of certain chemical elements, but not
the reality of chemical elements in general. Language, in the sense in
which we use the word, begins with roots, which are not only the
ultimate
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<a name = "page120" id = "page120"> </a>
facts for the Science of Language, but real facts in the history of
human speech. To deny their historical reality would be tantamount to
denying cause and effect.</p>

<p>Logically, no doubt, it is possible to distinguish between a root as
a mere postulate, and a root used as an actual word. That distinction
has been carefully elaborated by Indian grammarians and philosophers,
but it does in no way concern us in purely historical researches. What I
mean by a root used in real language is this: when we analyze a cluster
of Sanskrit words, such as <em>yodha-s</em>, a fighter,
<em>yodhaka-s</em>, a fighter, <em>yoddhâ</em>, a fighter,
<em>yodhana-m</em>, fighting, <em>yuddhi-s</em>, a fight,
<em>yuyutsu-s</em>, wishing to fight, <em>â-yudha-m</em>, a weapon, we
easily see that they presuppose an element <em>yudh</em>, to fight, and
that they are all derived from that element by well-known grammatical
suffixes. Now is this <em>yudh</em>, which we call the root of all these
words, a&nbsp;mere abstraction? Far from it. We find it as <em>yudh</em>
used in the Veda either as a nominal or as a verbal base, according to
suffixes by which it is followed. Thus <em>yudh</em> by itself would be
a fighter, only that <em>dh</em> when final, has to be changed
into&nbsp;t. We have <em>goshu-yúdh-am</em>, an accusative, the fighter
among cows. In the plural we have <em>yúdh-as</em>, fighters; in the
locative <em>yudh-i</em>, in the fight; in the instrumental,
<em>yudh-â</em>, with the weapon. That is to say, we find that as a
nominal base, <em>yudh</em>, without any determinative suffixes, may
express fighting, the place of fighting, the instrument of fighting, and
a fighter. If our grammatical analysis is right, we should have
<em>yudh</em> as a nominal base in <em>yúdh-ya-ti</em>, lit. he goes to
fighting, <em>yudh-yá-te</em>, pass.; <em>(a)-yut-smahi</em>, aor.,
either
<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
<a name = "page121" id = "page121"> </a>
we were to fight, or we were fighters; <em>yú-yut-sa-ti</em>, he is to
fight-fight; <em>yudh-ya-s</em>, to be fought (p.&nbsp;94), etc. As a
verbal base we find <em>yudh</em>, for instance, or <em>yu-yudh-e</em>,
I have fought; in <em>a-yud-dha</em>, for <em>a-yudh-ta</em>, he fought.
In the other Aryan languages this root has left hardly any traces; yet
the Greek <span class = "greek" title = "husmin">ὑσμῖν</span>, and <span
class = "greek" title = "husminê">ὑσμίνη</span> would be impossible
without the root <em>yudh</em>.</p>

<p>The only difference between Chinese and these Sanskrit forms which we
have just examined, is that while in Chinese such a form as
<em>yudh-i</em>, in the battle, would have for its last element a word
clearly meaning middle, and having an independent accent, Sanskrit has
lost the consciousness of the original material meaning of the <i>i</i>
of the locative, and uses it traditionally as an empty word, as a formal
element, as a mere termination.</p>

<p>I also agree with Curtius that during the earliest stage, not of
Sanskrit, but of Aryan speech in general, we have to admit two classes
of roots, the <i>predicative</i> and <i>demonstrative</i>, and that what
we now call the plural of <em>yudh</em>, <em>yudh-as</em>, fighters,
was, or may have been, originally a compound consisting of the
predicative root <em>yudh</em>, and the demonstrative root, <em>as</em>
or <em>sa</em>, possibly repeated twice, meaning “fight-he-he,” or
“fight-there-there,” <i>i.e.</i>, fighters.</p>

<p>There is another point with regard to the character of this earliest
radical stage of the Aryan language, on which formally I should have
agreed with Curtius, but where now I begin to feel more
doubtful,&mdash;I mean the necessarily monosyllabic form of all original
roots. There is, no doubt, much to be said for this view. We always like
to begin with what is simple. We imagine, as it has been said, that <ins
class = "correction" title = "text has ‘ for “">“the</ins> simple
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
<a name = "page122" id = "page122"> </a>
idea must break forth, like lightning, in a simple body of sound, to be
perceived in one single moment.” But, on the other hand, the simple, so
far as it is the general, is frequently, to us at least, the last result
of repeated complex conceptions, and therefore there is at all events no
<i>à priori</i> argument against treating the simplest roots as the
latest, rather than the earliest products of language. Languages in a
low state of development are rich in words expressive of the most minute
differences, they are poor in general expressions, a&nbsp;fact which
ought to be taken into account as an important qualification of a remark
made by Curtius that language supplies necessaries first, luxuries
afterwards (p.&nbsp;32). I&nbsp;quote the following excellent remarks
from Mr. Sayce’s “Principles of comparative Philology” (p.&nbsp;208):
“Among modern savages the individual objects of sense have names enough,
while general terms are very rare. The Mohicans have words for cutting
various objects, but none to signify cutting simple.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tagII_31" id = "tagII_31" href = "#noteII_31">31</a> In taking
this view we certainly are better able to explain the actual forms of
the <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Ayran’">Aryan</ins>
roots, viz., by <i>elimination</i>, rather than by <i>composition</i>.
If we look for instance, as I did myself formerly, on such roots as
<em>yudh</em>, <em>yuj</em>, and <em class = "sanskrit">yauṭ</em>, as
developed from the simpler root <em>yu</em>, or on <em>mardh</em>,
<em>marg</em>, <em>mark</em>, <em>marp</em>, <em>mard</em>,
<em>smar</em>, as developed from <em>mar</em>, then we are bound to
account
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
<a name = "page123" id = "page123"> </a>
for the modificatory elements, such as <i>dh</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>k</i>,
<i>p</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>r</i>, as remnants
of other roots, whether predicative or demonstrative. Thus Curtius
compares <em>tar</em> or <em>tra</em>, with <em>tras</em>,
<em>tram</em>, <em>trak</em>, <em>trap</em>; <em>tri</em> and
<em>tru</em> with <em>trup</em>, <em>trib</em>, taking the final
consonants as modificatory letters<ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ? for .">. </ins>But what are these modificatory letters?
Every attempt to account for them has failed. If it could be proved that
these modificatory elements, which Curtius calls <i>Determinatives</i>,
produced always the <i>same</i> modification of meaning, they might then
be classed with the verbal suffixes which change simple verbs into
causative, desiderative, or intensive verbs. But this is not the case.
On the other hand, it would be perfectly intelligible that such roots as
<em>mark</em>, <em>marg</em>, <em>mard</em>, <em>mardh</em>, expressing
different kinds of crushing, became fixed side by side, that by a
process of elimination, their distinguishing features were gradually
removed, and the root <em>mar</em> left as the simplest form, expressive
of the most general meaning. Without entering here on that process of
mutual friction by which I believe that the development of roots can
best be explained, we may say at least so much, that whatever process
will account for the root <em>yu</em>, will likewise account for the
root <em>yuj</em>, nay, that roots like <em>mark</em> or <em>mard</em>
are more graphic, expressive, and more easily intelligible than the root
mar.</p>

<p>However, if this view of the origin of roots has to be adopted, it
need not altogether exclude the other view. In the process of
simplification, certain final letters may have become typical, may have
seemed invested with a certain function or determinative power, and may
therefore have been added independently to other roots, by that powerful
imitative tendency
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
<a name = "page124" id = "page124"> </a>
which asserts itself again and again through the whole working of
language. But however that may be, the sharp line of distinction which
Curtius draws between the First Period, represented by simple, and the
Second Period represented by derivative roots, seems certainly no longer
tenable, least of all as dividing <i>chronologically</i> two distinct
periods in the growth of language.</p>

<p>When we approach the Third Period, it might seem that here, at least,
there could be no difference of opinion between Professor Curtius and
myself. That Third Period represents simply what I called the first
setting in of <i>combination</i>, following after the <i>isolating</i>
stage. Curtius calls it the <i>primary verbal period</i>, and ascribes
to it the origin of such combinatory forms as <em>dấ-ma</em>, give-I,
<em>dâ-tva</em>, give-thou, <em>dấ-ta</em>, give-he;
<em>dâ-ma-tvi</em>, give-we, <em>dâ-tva-tvi</em>, give-you,
<em>dâ-(a)nti</em>, give-they. These verbal forms he considers as much
earlier than any attempts at declension in nouns. No one who has read
Curtius’ arguments in support of this chronological arrangement would
deny their extreme plausibility; but there are grave difficulties which
made me hesitate in adopting this hypothetical framework of linguistic
chronology. I&nbsp;shall only mention one, which seemed to me
insurmountable. We know that during what we called the First Radical
Period the sway of phonetic laws was already so firmly established,
that, from that period onward to the present day, we can say, with
perfect certainty, which phonetic changes are possible, and which are
not. It is through these phonetic laws that the most distant past in the
history of the Aryan language is connected with the present. It is on
them that the
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<a name = "page125" id = "page125"> </a>
whole science of etymology is founded. Only because a certain root has a
tenuis, a&nbsp;media, an aspirate, or a sibilant, is it possible to keep
it distinct from other roots. If t and s could be interchanged, then the
root <em>tar</em>, to cross, would not be distinct from the root
<em>sar</em>, to go. If d and <em>dh</em> could vary, then <em>dar</em>,
to tear, would run together with <em>dhar</em>, to hold. These phonetic
distinctions were firmly established in the radical period, and continue
to be maintained, both in the undivided Aryan speech, and in the divided
national dialects, such as Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Gothic. How then
can we allow an intervening period, during which <em>ma-tvi</em>, could
become <em>masi</em>, <em>tva-tvi</em>, <em>thas</em>, and the same
<em>tva-tvi</em> appear also as <em>sai</em>? Such changes, always most
startling, may have been possible in earlier periods; but when phonetic
order had once been established, as it was in what Curtius calls his
first and second periods, to admit them as possible, would be, as far as
I can judge, to admit a complete anachronism. Of two things one; either
we must altogether surrender those chaotic changes which are required
for identifying Sanskrit e with Greek <span class = "greek" title =
"mai">μαι</span>, and Greek <span class = "greek" title =
"mai">μαι</span> with <em>mâ-ma</em>, etc., or we must throw them back
to a period anterior to the final settlement of the Aryan roots.</p>

<p>I now proceed to point out a second difficulty. If Curtius uses these
same personal terminations, <em>masi</em>, <em>tvasi</em>, and
<em>anti</em>, as proof positive that they must have been compounded out
of <em>ma</em> + <em>tva</em>, and <em>tva-tva</em>, before there were
any case terminations, I&nbsp;do not think his argument is quite
stringent. Curtius says: “If plural suffixes had existed before the
coining of these terminations, we should expect them here, as well as in
the noun” (p.&nbsp;33). But the plural of the
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<a name = "page126" id = "page126"> </a>
pronoun <i>I</i> could never have been formed by a plural suffix, like
the plural of <i>horse</i>. <i>I</i> admits of no plural, as little as
<i>thou</i>, and hence the plural of these very pronouns in the Aryan
language is not formed by the mere addition of a plural termination, but
by a new base. We say <i>I</i>, but <i>we</i>; <i>thou</i> but
<i>you</i>, and so through all the Aryan languages. According to Curtius
himself, <em>masi</em>, the termination of the plural, is not formed by
repeating <em>ma</em>, by saying I and I, but by <em>ma</em> and
<em>tva</em>, I and thou, the most primitive way, he thinks, of
expressing <i>we</i>. The termination of the second person plural might
be expressed by repeating <i>thou</i>. “You did it,” might have been
rendered by “thou and thou did it;” but hardly by treating <i>thou</i>
like a noun, and adding to it a plural termination. The absence of
plural terminations, therefore at the end of the personal suffixes of
the verbs, does not prove, as far as I can see, that plurals of nouns
were unknown when the first, second, and third persons plural of the
Aryan verbs were called into existence.</p>

<p>Again, if Curtius says, that “what language has once learnt, it does
not forget again, and that therefore if the plural had once found
expression in nouns, the verb would have claimed the same distinction,”
is true, no doubt, in many cases, but not so generally true as to supply
a safe footing for a deductive argument. In so late a formation as the
periphrastic future in Sanskrit, we say <em class =
"sanskrit">dâtâ-smaḥ</em>, as it were <i>dator sumus</i>, not <em class
= "sanskrit">dâtâraḥ smaḥ</em>; and in the second person plural of the
passive in Latin <i>amamini</i>, though the plural is marked, the gender
is always disregarded.</p>

<p>Further, even if we admit with Bopp and Curtius that the terminations
of the medium are composed of
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<a name = "page127" id = "page127"> </a>
two pronouns, that the <i>ta</i> of the third person singular stands for
<i>ta-ti</i>, to-him-he, that <span class = "greek" title =
"kaluptetai">καλύπτεται</span> in fact meant originally hide-himself-he,
it does not follow that in such a compound one pronominal element should
have taken the termination of the accusative, any more than the other
takes the termination of the nominative. The first element in every
composition takes necessarily its Pada or thematic form; the second or
final element has suffered so much, according to Bopp’s own explanation,
that nothing would be easier to explain than the disappearance of a
final consonant, if it had existed. The absence of case-terminations in
such compounds cannot therefore be used as proof of the non-existence of
case-terminations at a time when the medial and other personal endings
took their origin. On the contrary, these terminations seem to me to
indicate, though I do not say to prove, that the conception of a
subjective, as distinct from an objective case, had been fully realized
by those who framed them. I&nbsp;do not myself venture to speak very
positively of such minute processes of analysis as that which discovers
in the Sk. first pers. sing. ind. pres. of the middle, tude,
I&nbsp;strike, an original <em>tuda</em> + a + i, <em>tuda</em> +
<em>ma</em> + i, <em>tuda</em> + <em>ma</em> + <em>mi</em>, tuda +
<em>mâ</em> + <em>ma</em>, but admitting that the middle was formed in
that way, and that it meant originally <i>strike-to-me-I</i>, then
surely we have in the first <em>mâ</em> an oblique case, and in the
compound itself the clearest indication that the distinction between a
nominative and an oblique case, whether dative or accusative, was no
longer a mystery. Anyhow, and this is the real point at issue, the
presence of such compounds as <em>mâ-ma</em>, to-me-I, is in no way a
proof that at the time of their formation people could not
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<a name = "page128" id = "page128"> </a>
distinguish between <em>yudh (s)</em>, nom., a&nbsp;fighter, and
<em>yudh (am)</em>, acc., a&nbsp;fighter; and we must wait for more
irrefragable evidence before admitting, what would under all
circumstances be a most startling conclusion, namely, that the Aryan
language was spoken for a long time without case-terminations, but with
a complete set of personal terminations, both in the singular and the
plural. For though it is quite true that the want of cases could only be
felt in a sentence, the same seems to me to apply to personal
terminations of the verb. The one, in most languages we know, implies
the other, and the very question whether conjugation or declension came
first is one of those dangerous questions which take something for
granted which has never been proved.</p>

<p>During all this time, according to Curtius, our Aryan language would
have consisted of nothing but roots, used for nominal and verbal
purposes, but without any purely derivative suffixes, whether verbal or
nominal, and without declension. The only advance, in fact, made beyond
the purely Chinese standard, would have consisted in a few combinations
of personal pronouns with verbal stems, which combinations assumed
rapidly a typical character, and led to the formation of a skeleton of
conjugation, containing a <i>present</i>, <i>an aorist</i> with an
augment, and a <i>reduplicated perfect</i>. Why, during the same period,
nominal bases should not have assumed at least some case-terminations,
does not appear; and it certainly seems strange that people who could
say <em>vak-ti</em>, speak-he, <em>vak-anti</em>, speak-this-he, should
not have been able to say <em>vâk-s</em>, whether in the sense of
speak-there, <i>i.e.</i>, speech or speak-there, <i>i.e.</i>,
speaker.</p>

<p>The next step which, according to Curtius, the
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
<a name = "page129" id = "page129"> </a>
Aryan language had to make, in order to emerge from its purely radical
phase, was the creation of bases, both verbal and nominal, by the
addition of verbal and nominal suffixes to roots, both primary and
secondary. Curtius calls this fourth the Period of the <i>Formation of
Themes</i>. The suffixes are very numerous, and it is by them that the
Aryan languages have been able to make their limited number of roots
supply the vast materials of their dictionary. From <em>bhar</em>, to
carry, they formed <em>bhar-a</em>, a carrier, but sometimes also a
burden. In addition to <em>bhar-ti</em>, carry-he, they formed
<em>bhara-ti</em>, meaning possibly carrying-he. The growth of these
early themes may have been very luxuriant, and, as Professor Curtius
expresses it, chiefly <i>paraschematic</i>. It may have been left to a
later age to assign to that large number of possible synonyms more
definite meanings. Thus from <span class = "greek" title =
"pherô">φέρω</span>, I&nbsp;carry, we have <span class = "greek" title =
"phora">φορά</span>, the act of carrying, used also in the sense of
<i>impetus</i> (being carried away), and of <i>provectus</i>, i.e., what
is brought in. <span class = "greek" title = "Phoros">Φορός</span> means
carrying, but also violent, and lucrative; <span class = "greek" title =
"pheretron">φέρετρον</span>, an instrument of carrying, means a bier;
<span class = "greek" title = "pharetra">φαρέτρα</span>, a&nbsp;quiver,
for carrying arrows. <span class = "greek" title =
"Phormos">Φορμός</span> comes to mean a basket; <span class = "greek"
title = "phortos">φόρτος</span>, a&nbsp;burden; <span class = "greek"
title = "phoros">φορός</span>, tribute.</p>

<p>All this is perfectly intelligible, both with regard to nominal and
verbal themes. Curtius admits four kinds of verbal themes as the outcome
of his Fourth Period. He had assigned to his Third Period the simple
verbal themes <span class = "greek" title = "es-ti">ἐσ-τί</span>, and
the reduplicated themes such as <span class = "greek" title =
"didô-si">δίδω-σι</span>. To these were added, in the Fourth Period, the
following four secondary <span class =
"locked">themes:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class = "inline wide">
<tr>
<td>(1) <span class = "greek" title =
"plek-e-(t)-i">πλέκ-ε-(τ)-ι</span></td>
<td>Sanskrit <em>lipa-ti</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(2) <span class = "greek" title =
"aleiph-e-(t)-i">ἀλείφ-ε-(τ)-ι</span></td>
<td>&emsp; „&emsp;&emsp;<em>laipa-ti</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<a name = "page130" id = "page130"> </a>
(3) <span class = "greek" title = "deik-nu-si">δείκ-νυ-σι</span></td>
<td>&emsp; „&emsp;&emsp;<em>lip-nau-ti</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(4) <span class = "greek" title = "dam-nê-si">δάμ-νη-σι</span></td>
<td>&emsp; „&emsp;&emsp;<em>lip-nâ-ti</em>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>He also explains the formation of the subjunctive in analogy with
bases such as <em>lipa-ti</em>, as derived from <em>lip-ti</em>.</p>

<p>Some scholars would probably feel inclined to add one or two of the
more primitive verbal themes, such as</p>

<table class = "inline wide">
<tr>
<td>limpa-ti</td>
<td><i>rumpo</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>limpana-ti</td>
<td><span class = "greek" title = "lambane(t)i">λαμβάνε(τ)ι</span></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>but all would probably agree with Curtius in placing the formation of
these themes, both verbal and nominal, between the radical and the
latest inflectional period. A&nbsp;point, however, on which there would
probably be considerable difference of opinion is this, whether it is
credible, that at a time when so many nominal themes were
formed,&mdash;for Curtius ascribes to this Fourth Period the formation
of such nominal bases as</p>

<table class = "inline wide">
<tr>
<td><span class = "greek" title = "log-o">λόγ-ο</span>, intellect,</td>
<td>= <em>lipa-ti</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class = "greek" title = "loip-o">λοίπ-ο</span>, left,</td>
<td>= <em>laipa-ti</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class = "greek" title = "lig-nu">λιγ-νύ</span>, smoke,</td>
<td>= <em>lip-nau-ti</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class = "greek" title = "daph-nê">δάφ-νη</span>, laurel,</td>
<td>= <em>lip-nâ-ti</em> &mdash;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>the simplest nominal compounds, which we now call nominative and
accusative, singular and plural, were still unknown; that people could
say <em class = "sanskrit">dhṛsh-nu-más</em>, we dare, but not <em class
= "sanskrit">dhṛsh-ṇú-s</em>, daring-he; that they had an imperative,
<em class = "sanskrit">dhṛshṇuhí</em>, dare, but not a vocative, <em
class = "sanskrit">dhṛshṇo</em>? Curtius strongly holds to that opinion,
but with regard to this period too, he does not seem to me to establish
it by a regular and complete argument. Some arguments which he refers to
occasionally have been answered before. Another, which he brings in
incidentally, when discussing
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<a name = "page131" id = "page131"> </a>
the abbreviation of certain suffixes, can hardly be said to carry
conviction. After tracing the suffixes <em>ant</em> and <em>tar</em>
back to what he supposes to have been their more primitive forms,
<em>an-ta</em> and <em>ta-ra</em>, he remarks that the dropping of the
final vowel would hardly be conceivable at a time when there existed
case-terminations. Still this dropping of the vowel is very common, in
late historical times, in Latin, for instance, and other Italian
dialects, where it causes frequent confusion and heteroclitism.<a class
= "tag" name = "tagII_32" id = "tagII_32" href = "#noteII_32">32</a>
Thus the Augustan <i>innocua</i> was shortened in common pronunciation
to <i>innoca</i>, and this dwindles down in Christian inscriptions to
<i>innox</i>. In Greek, too, <span class = "greek" title =
"diaktoros">διάκτορος</span> is older than <span class = "greek" title =
"diaktôr">διάκτωρ</span>; <span class = "greek" title =
"phulakos">φύλακος</span> older than <span class = "greek" title =
"phulax">φύλαξ</span>.</p>

<p>Nor can it be admitted that the nominal suffixes have suffered less
from phonetic corruption than the terminations of the verb, and that
therefore they must belong to a more modern period
(pp.&nbsp;39,&nbsp;40). In spite of all the changes which the personal
terminations are supposed to have undergone, their connection with the
personal pronouns has always been apparent, while the tracing back of
the nominal suffixes, and, still more, of the case-terminations to their
typical elements, forms still one of the greatest difficulties of
comparative grammarians.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_33" id =
"tagII_33" href = "#noteII_33">33</a></p>

<p>Professor Curtius is so much impressed with the later origin of
declension that he establishes one more period, the fifth, to which he
assigns the growth of all compound verbal forms, compound stems,
compound tenses, and compound moods, before he allows the first
beginnings of declension, and the
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
<a name = "page132" id = "page132"> </a>
formation even of such simple forms as the nominative and accusative. It
is difficult, no doubt, to disprove such an opinion by facts or dates,
because there are none to be found on either side: but we have a right
to expect very strong arguments indeed, before we can admit that at a
time when an aorist, like <span class = "greek" title =
"edeik-sa">ἔδεικ-σα</span>, Sanskrit <em>a-dik-sha-t</em> was possible,
that is to say, at a time when the verb <em>as</em>, which meant
originally to breathe, had by constant use been reduced to the meaning
of being; at a time when that verb, as a mere auxiliary, was joined to a
verbal base in order to impart to it a general historical power; when
the persons of the verb were distinguished by pronominal elements, and
when the augment, no longer purely demonstrative, had become the symbol
of time past, that at such a time people were still unable to
distinguish, except by a kind of Chinese law of position, between “the
father struck the child,” and “the child struck the father.” Before we
can admit this, we want much stronger proofs than any adduced by
Curtius. He says, for instance, that compound verbal bases formed with
<em>yâ</em>, to go, and afterwards fixed as causatives, would be
inconceivable during a period in which accusatives existed. From
<em>naś</em>, to perish, we form in Sanskrit <em>nâśa-yâmi</em>, I make
perish. This, according to Curtius, would have meant originally,
I&nbsp;send to perishing. Therefore <em>nâśa</em> would have been, in
the accusative, <em>nâśam</em>, and the causative would have been
<em>nâśamyâmi</em>, if the accusative had then been known. But we have
in Latin<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_34" id = "tagII_34" href =
"#noteII_34">34</a> <i>pessum dare</i>, <i>venum ire</i>, and no one
would say that compounds like <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘cafleacio’"><i>calefacio</i></ins>, <i>liquefacio</i>,
<i>putrefacio</i>, were impossible after the first Aryan separation, or
after that
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
<a name = "page133" id = "page133"> </a>
still earlier period to which Curtius assigns the formation of the Aryan
case-terminations. Does Professor Curtius hold that compound forms like
Gothic <i>nasi-da</i> were formed not only before the Aryan separation,
but before the introduction of case-terminations? I&nbsp;hold, on the
contrary, that such really old compositions never required, nay never
admitted, the accusative. We say in Sanskrit, <em>dyu-gat</em>, going to
the sky, <em>dyu-ksha</em>, dwelling in the sky, without any
case-terminations at the end of the first part of the compound. We say
in Greek, <span class = "greek" title =
"sakes-palos">σακέσ-παλος</span>, not <span class = "greek" title =
"sakos-palos">σάκοσ-παλος</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"paidophonos">παιδοφόνος</span>, not <span class = "greek" title =
"paidaphonos">παιδαφόνος</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"ores-kôios">ὀρεσ-κῷος</span>, mountain-bred, and also <span class =
"greek" title = "oresi-trophos">ὀρεσί-τροφος</span>, mountain-fed. We
say in Latin, <i>agri-cola</i>, not <i>agrum-cola</i>,
<i>fratri-cīda</i>, not <i>fratrem-cīda</i>, <i>rēgĭfugium</i>, not
<i>regis-fugium</i>. Are we to suppose that all these words were formed
before there was an outward mark of distinction between nominative and
accusative in the primitive Aryan language? Such compounds, we know, can
be formed at pleasure, and they continued to be formed long after the
full development of the Aryan declension, and the same would apply to
the compound stems of causal verbs. To say, as Curtius does, that
composition was possible only before the development of declension,
because when cases had once sprung up, the people would no longer have
known the bases of nouns, is far too strong an assertion. In Sanskrit<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_35" id = "tagII_35" href =
"#noteII_35">35</a> the really difficult bases are generally
sufficiently visible in the so-called Pada, cases, <i>i.e.</i>, before
certain terminations beginning with consonants, and there is besides a
strong feeling of analogy in language, which would generally, though not
always (for compounds are frequently
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
<a name = "page134" id = "page134"> </a>
framed by false analogy), guide the framers of new compounds rightly in
the selection of the proper nominal base. It seems to me that even with
us there is still a kind of instinctive feeling against using nouns,
articulated with case-terminations, for purposes of composition,
although there are exceptions to that rule in ancient, and many more in
modern languages. We can hardly realize to ourselves a Latin
<i>pontemfex</i>, or <i>pontisfex</i>, still less <i>ponsfex</i> instead
of <i>pontifex</i>, and when the Romans drove away their kings, they did
not speak of a <i>regisfugium</i> or a <i>regumfugium</i>, but they
took, by habit or by instinct, the base <i>regi</i>, though none of
them, if they had been asked, knew what a base was. Composition, we
ought not to forget, is after all only another name for combination, and
the very essence of combination consists in joining together words which
are not yet articulated grammatically. Whenever we form compounds, such
as <i>railway</i>, we are still moving in the combinatory stage, and we
have the strongest proof that the life of language is not capable of
chronological division. There was a period in the growth of the Aryan
language when the principle of combination preponderated, when
inflection was as yet unknown. But inflection itself was the result of
combination, and unless combination had continued long after inflection
set in, the very life of language would have become extinct.</p>

<p>I have thus tried to explain why I cannot accept the fundamental fact
on which the seven-fold division of the history of the Aryan language is
founded, viz., that the combinatory process which led to the Aryan
system of conjugation would have been impossible, if at the time nominal
bases had already been articulated
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
<a name = "page135" id = "page135"> </a>
with terminations of case and number. I&nbsp;see no reason why the
earliest case-formations, I&nbsp;mean particularly the nominative and
accusative in the singular, plural, and dual, should not date from the
same time as the earliest formations of conjugation. The same process
that leads to the formation of <em>vak-ti</em>, speak-he, would account
for the formation of <em>vak-s</em>, speak-there, <i>i.e.</i>, speaker.
Necessity, which after all is the mother of all inventions, would much
sooner have required the clear distinction of singular and plural, of
nominative and accusative, than of the three persons, of the verbs. It
is far more important to be able to distinguish the subject and the
object in such sentences as “the son has killed the father,” or “the
father has killed the son,” than to be able to indicate the person and
tense of the verb. Of course we may say that in Chinese the two cases
are distinguished without any outward signs, and by mere position; but
we have no evidence that the law of position was preserved in the Aryan
languages, after verbal inflection had once set in. Chinese dispenses
with verbal inflection as well as with nominal, and an appeal to it
would therefore prove either too much or too little.</p>

<p>At the end of the five periods which we have examined, but still
before the Aryan separation, Curtius places the sixth, which he calls
the Period of the Formation of Cases, and the seventh, the Period of
Adverbs. Why I cannot bring myself to accept the late date here assigned
to declension, I&nbsp;have tried to explain before. That adverbs existed
before the great branches of Aryan speech became definitely separated
has been fully proved by Professor Curtius. I&nbsp;only doubt whether
the adverbial period can be
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
<a name = "page136" id = "page136"> </a>
separated chronologically from the case period. I&nbsp;should say, on
the contrary, that some of the adverbs in Sanskrit and the other Aryan
languages exhibit the most primitive and obsolete case-terminations, and
that they existed probably long before the system of case-terminations
assumed its completeness.</p>

<p>If we look back at the results at which we have arrived in examining
the attempt of Professor Curtius to establish seven distinct
chronological periods in the history of the Aryan speech, previous to
its separation into Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Slavonic, Teutonic, and
Celtic, I&nbsp;think we shall find two principles clearly <span class =
"locked">established:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. That it is impossible to distinguish more than <i>three</i>
successive phases in the growth of the Aryan language. In the first
phase or period the only materials were roots, not yet compounded, still
less articulated grammatically, a&nbsp;form of language to us almost
inconceivable, yet even at present preserved in the literature and
conversation of millions of human beings, the Chinese. In that stage of
language, “king rule man heap law instrument,” would mean, the king
rules men legally.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> phase is characterized by the combination of roots,
by which process one loses its independence and its accent, and is
changed from a full and material into an empty or formal element. That
phase comprehends the formation of compound roots, of certain nominal
and verbal stems, and of the most necessary forms of declension and
conjugation. What distinguishes this phase from the inflectional is the
consciousness of the speaker, that one part of his word is the stem or
the body, and all the rest its environment, a&nbsp;feeling analogous to
that which we have
<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<a name = "page137" id = "page137"> </a>
when we speak of <i>man</i>-hood, <i>man</i>-ly, <i>man</i>-ful,
<i>man</i>-kind, but which fails us when we speak of <i>man</i> and
<i>men</i>, or if we speak of <i>wo-man</i>, instead of <i>wif-man</i>.
The principle of combination preponderated when inflection was as yet
unknown. But inflection itself was the result of combination, and unless
it had continued long after inflection set in, the very life of language
would have become extinct.</p>

<p>The <i>third</i> phase is the inflectional, when the base and the
modificatory elements of words coalesce, lose their independence in the
mind of the speaker, and simply produce the impression of modification
taking place in the body of words, but without any intelligible reason.
This is the feeling which we have throughout nearly the whole of our own
language, and it is only by means of scientific reflection that we
distinguish between the root, the base, the suffix, and the termination.
To attempt more than this three-fold division seems to me
impossible.</p>

<p>2. The second principle which I tried to establish was that the
growth of language does not lend itself to a chronological division, in
the strict sense of the word. Whatever forces are at work in the
formation of languages, none of them ceases suddenly to make room for
another, but they work on with a certain continuity from beginning to
end, only on a larger or smaller scale. Inflection does not put a sudden
end to combination, nor combination to juxtaposition. When even in so
modern a language as English we can form by mere combination such words
as <i>man-like</i>, and reduce them to <i>manly</i>, the power of
combination cannot be said to be extinct, although it may no longer be
sufficiently strong to produce new cases or new personal terminations.
We may admit,
<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
<a name = "page138" id = "page138"> </a>
in the development of the Aryan language, previous to its division,
three successive strata of formation, a&nbsp;<i>juxtapositional</i>, a
<i>combinatory</i>, and an <i>inflectional</i>; but we shall have to
confess that these strata are not regularly superimposed, but tilted,
broken up, and convulsed. They are very prominent each for a time, but
even after that time is over, they may be traced at different points,
pervading the very latest formations of tertiary speech. The true motive
power in the progress of all language is combination, and that power is
not extinct even in our own time.</p>

In my essay <i>On the Relation of Bengali to the Aryan and Aboriginal
Languages of India</i>, published in 1848, I&nbsp;tried to explain these
plural suffixes, such as <em>dig</em>, <em class = "sanskrit">gaṇa</em>,
<em>jâti</em>, <em>varga</em>, <em>dala</em>. I had translated the last
word by <i>band</i>, supposing from Wilson’s Dictionary, and from the
Śabda-kalpa-druma that <i>dala</i> could be used in the sense of band or
multitude. I&nbsp;doubt, however, whether <i>dala</i> is ever used in
Sanskrit in that sense, and I feel certain that it was not used in that
sense with sufficient frequency to account for its adoption in Bengali.
Dr. Friedrich Müller, in his useful abstracts of some of the grammars
discovered by the <i>Novara</i> in her journey round the earth
(1857&ndash;59), has likewise referred <em>dal</em> to the Sanskrit
<em>dala</em>, but he renders what I had in English rendered by
<i>band</i>, by the German word <i>Band</i>. This can only be an
accident. I&nbsp;meant <i>band</i> in the sense of a band of robbers,
which in German would be <i>Bande</i>. He seems to have misunderstood
me, and to have taken <i>band</i> for the German <i>Band</i>, which
means a ribbon. Might <em>dala</em> in Bengali be the Dravidian <em
class = "sanskrit">taḷa</em> or <em class = "sanskrit">daḷa</em>, a
host, a&nbsp;crowd, which Dr. Caldwell (p.&nbsp;197) mentions as a
possible etymon of the pluralizing suffix in the Dravidian languages?
Bengali certainly took the idea of forming its plurals by composition
with words expressive of plurality from its Dravidian neighbor, and it
is not impossible that in some cases it might have transferred the very
word <em class = "sanskrit">daḷa</em>, crowd. This <em class =
"sanskrit">daḷa</em> and <em class = "sanskrit">taḷa</em> appears in
Tamil as <i>kala</i> and <i>gala</i>, and as Sanskrit <ins class =
"notation" title = "italicized, but ‘k’ seems to be intended"><i>k</i></ins> may in Sinhalese be represented by <i>v</i>
(<em>loka</em> = <i>lova</i>), I thought that the plural termination
used in Sinhalese after inanimate nouns might possibly be a corruption
of the Tamil <i>kala</i>. Mr. Childers, however, in his able “Essay on
the formation of the Plural of Neuter Nouns in Sinhalese” (<i>J.&nbsp;R.
A.&nbsp;S.</i>, 1874, p.&nbsp;40), thinks that the Sinhalese <i>vala</i>
is a corruption of the Sanskrit <em>vana</em>, forest, an opinion which
seems likewise to be held by Mr. D’Alwis (l.c. p.&nbsp;48). As a case in
point, in support of mv own opinion, Mr. Childers mentioned to me the
Sinhalese <i>malvaru</i>, Sanskrit <em>mâlâ-kâra</em>, a wreath-maker,
a&nbsp;gardener. In Persian both <i>ân</i> and <i>hâ</i> are remnants of
decayed plural terminations, not collective words added to the base.</p>

Endlicher, <i>Chinesische Grammatik</i>, § 122. Wade, <i>Progressive
Course on the Parts of Speech</i>, p.&nbsp;102. A&nbsp;different
division of words adopted by Chinese grammarians is that into
<i>dead</i> and <i>live words</i>, <i>ssè-tsé</i> and <i>sing-tsé</i>,
the former comprising nouns, the latter verbs. The same classes are
sometimes called <i>tsing-tsé</i> and <i>ho-tsé</i>, unmoved and moved
words. This shows how purposeless it would be to try to find out whether
language began with noun or verb. In the earliest phase of speech the
same word was both noun and verb, according to the use that was made of
it, and it is so still to a great extent in Chinese. See Endlicher,

Professor Pott, in his article entitled “Max Müller und die Kennzeichen
der Sprach&shy;verwandt&shy;schaft,” published in 1855, in the
<i>Journal of the German Oriental Society</i>, vol. ix. p.&nbsp;412,
says, in confutation of Bunsen’s view of a real historical progress of
language from the lowest to the highest stage: “So cautious an inquirer
as W.&nbsp;von Humboldt declines expressly, in the last chapter of his
work on the <i>Diversity of the Structure of Human Language</i>
(p.&nbsp;414), any conclusions as to a real historical progress from one
stage of language to another, or at least does not commit himself to any
definite opinion. This is surely something very different from that
gradual progress, and it would be a question whether, by admitting such
an historical progress from stage to stage, we should not commit an
absurdity hardly less palpable than by trying to raise infusoria into
horses or still further into men. [What was an absurdity in 1855 does
not seem to be so in 1875.] Mr. Bunsen, it is true, does not hesitate to
call the monosyllabic idiom of the Chinese an inorganic formation. But
how can we get from an inorganic to an organic language? In nature such
a thing would be impossible. No stone becomes a plant, no plant a tree,
by however wonderful a metamorphosis, except, in a different sense, by
the process of nutrition, <i>i.e.</i>, by regeneration. The former
question, which Mr. Bunsen answers in the affirmative, is disposed of by
him with the short dictum: ‘The question whether a language can be
supposed to begin with inflections, appears to us simply an absurdity;’
but unfortunately he does not condescend, by a clear illustration, to
make that absurdity palpable. Why, in inflectional languages, should the
grammatical form always have added itself to the matter subsequently and

“Time changes the meaning of words as it does their sound. Thus, many
old words are retained in compounds, but have lost their original
signification. E.g., <i>’k·eu</i>, mouth, has been replaced in
colloquial usage by <i>’tsui</i>, but it is still employed extensively
in compound terms and in derived senses. Thus, <i>k·wai‘ ’k·eu</i> a
rapid talker, <i>.men ’k·eu</i>, door, <i>,kwan ’k·eu</i>, custom house.
So also <i>muh</i>, the original word for eye, has given place to
<i>’yen, tsing</i>, or <i>’yen</i> alone. It is, however, employed with
other words in derived senses. E.g., <i>muh hia·</i>, at present; <i>muh
luh</i>, table of contents.</p>

In old Latin the termination of the first person singular was <i>em</i>.
Thus Quintilian, i. 7, 23, says: “Quid? non Cato Censorius <i>dicam</i>

Neue, <i>Formenlehre</i>, ii. p.&nbsp;348. The introduction of
<i>feram</i>, originally a subjunctive, to express the future in the
first person, reminds us of the distinction in English between <i>I
shall</i> and <i>thou wilt</i>, though the analogy fails in the first
person plural. In Homer the use of the subjunctive for the future is
well known. See Curtius, <i>Chronologie</i>, p.&nbsp;50.</p>

In <span class = "greek" title = "dô-sô">δώ-σω</span>, for <span class =

traces of a similar future in forms like <i>fac-so</i>, <i>cap-so</i>,

of the house, and <i>etche-tic-acoa</i>, he who is of the house; or from

Until a rational account of these changes, comprehended under the name
of <i>Lautverschiebung</i>, is given, we must continue to look upon
them, not as the result of phonetic decay, but of dialectic growth.
I&nbsp;am glad to find that this is more and more admitted by those who
think for themselves, instead of simply repeating the opinions of
others. Grimm’s Law stands no longer alone, as peculiar to the Teutonic
languages, but analogous changes have been pointed out in the
South-African, the Chinese, the Polynesian dialects, showing that these
changes are everywhere collateral, not successive. I&nbsp;agree with
Professor Curtius and other scholars that the impulse to what we call
<i>Lautverschiebung</i> was given by the third modification in each
series of consonants, by the <i>gh</i>, <i>dh</i>, <i>bh</i> in
Sanskrit, the χ, θ, φ, in Greek. I&nbsp;differ from him in considering
the changes of <i>Lautverschiebung</i> as the result of dialectic
variety, while he sees their motive power in phonetic corruption. But
whether we take the one view or the other, I&nbsp;do not see that Dr.
Scherer has removed any of our difficulties. See Curtius,
<i>Grundzüge</i>, 4th ed., p.&nbsp;426, note. Dr. Scherer, in his
thoughtful work, <i>Zur Geschichte der Deutschen Sprache</i>, has very
nearly, though not quite, apprehended the meaning of my explanation as
to the effects of dialectic change contrasted with those of phonetic
decay. If it is allowable to use a more homely illustration, one might
say with perfect truth, that each dialect chooses its own phonetic
garment, as people choose the coats and trousers which best fit them.
The simile, like all similes, is imperfect, yet it is far more exact
than if we compare the ravages of phonetic decay, as is frequently done,
to the wear and tear of these phonetic suits.</p>

de rapprocher et d’identifier, par les sons, des mots mongols et chinois
ayant la même signification. Son systême m’a paru mal fondé. Quelques
mots chinois peuvent être entrés dans la langue mongole par suite du
contact des deux peuples, comme cela est arrivé pour le mandchou, dont

certains mots mandchous ne prouve point le moins du monde l’identité des
deux langues. Par exemple, un préfet se dit en chinois <i>tchi-fou</i>,

These remarks, made by one who, during his lifetime, was recognised by
friend and foe as the first Chinese scholar in Europe, ought to have
their proper weight. They ought certainly to make us cautious before
persuading ourselves that the connection between the northern and
southern branches of the Turanian languages has been found in Chinese.
On the other hand I am quite aware that all that M.&nbsp;Stanislas
Julien says against Mr. Edkins may be true, and that nevertheless
Chinese may have been the central language from which Mongolian in the
north and Tibetan in the south branched off. A&nbsp;language, such as
Chinese, with a small number of sounds and an immense number of
meanings, can easily give birth to dialects which, in their later
development, might branch off in totally different directions. Even with
languages so closely connected as Sanskrit and Latin, it would be easy
to make out a list of a thousand words in Latin which could not be
matched in Sanskrit. The question, therefore, is not decided. What is
wanted are researches carried on by competent scholars, in an
unprejudiced and at the same time thoroughly scientific spirit.</p>

different colored cattle, or for different maize cobs, to express
certain minute peculiarities of color or arrangement of color, which it
is difficult for us to grasp, are not synonymous, but instances in which
a new noun or name is used instead of adding adjectives to one name to
express the various conditions of an object. Neither are these various
verbs used to express varieties of the same action, synonyms, such as

<p><span class = "firstword">“Count</span> not your chickens before they
be hatched,” is a well-known proverb in English, and most people, if
asked what was its origin, would probably appeal to La Fontaine’s
delightful fable, <i>La Laitière et le Pot au Lait</i>.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIII_1" id = "tagIII_1" href = "#noteIII_1">1</a> We all know
Perrette, lightly stepping along from her village to the town, carrying
the milk-pail on her head, and in her day-dreams selling her milk for a
good sum, then buying a hundred eggs, then selling the chickens, then
buying a pig, fattening it, selling it again, and buying a cow with a
calf. The calf frolics about, and kicks up his legs&mdash;so does
Perrette, and, alas! the pail falls down, the milk is spilt, her riches
gone, and she only hopes when she comes home that she may escape a
flogging from her husband.</p>

<p>Did La Fontaine invent this fable? or did he merely follow the
example of Sokrates, who, as we know from the Phædon,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIII_2" id = "tagIII_2" href = "#noteIII_2">2</a> occupied
himself in prison, during the last days of his life, with turning into
verse some of the fables, or, as he calls them, the myths of Æsop.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<a name = "page140" id = "page140"> </a>
<p>La Fontaine published the first six books of his fables in 1668,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIII_3" id = "tagIII_3" href =
"#noteIII_3">3</a> and it is well known that the subjects of most of
these early fables were taken from Æsop, Phædrus, Horace, and other
classical fabulists, if we may adopt this word “fabuliste,” which La
Fontaine was the first to introduce into French.</p>

<p>In 1678 a second edition of these six books was published, enriched
by five books of new fables, and in 1694 a new edition appeared,
containing one additional book, thus completing the collection of his
charming poems.</p>

<p>The fable of Perrette stands in the seventh book, and was published,
therefore, for the first time in the edition of 1678. In the preface to
that edition La Fontaine says: “It is not necessary that I should say
whence I have taken the subjects of these new fables. I&nbsp;shall only
say, from a sense of gratitude, that I owe the largest portion of them
to Pilpay the Indian sage.”</p>

<p>If, then, La Fontaine tells us himself that he borrowed the subjects
of most of his new fables from Pilpay, the Indian sage, we have clearly
a right to look to India in order to see whether, in the ancient
literature of that country, any traces can be discovered of Perrette
with the milk-pail.</p>

<p>Sanskrit literature is very rich in fables and stories; no other
literature can vie with it in that respect; nay, it is extremely likely
that fables, in particular animal fables, had their principal source in
India. In the sacred literature of the Buddhists, fables held a most
prominent place. The Buddhist preachers, addressing themselves chiefly
to the people, to the untaught,
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<a name = "page141" id = "page141"> </a>
the uncared for, the outcast, spoke to them, as we still speak to
children, in fables, in proverbs and parables. Many of these fables and
parables must have existed before the rise of the Buddhist religion;
others, no doubt, were added on the spur of the moment, just as Sokrates
would invent a myth or fable whenever that form of argument seemed to
him most likely to impress and convince his hearers. But Buddhism gave a
new and permanent sanction to this whole branch of moral mythology, and
in the sacred canon, as it was settled in the third century before
Christ, many a fable received, and holds to the present day, its
recognized place. After the fall of Buddhism in India, and even during
its decline, the Brahmans claimed the inheritance of their enemies, and
used their popular fables for educational purposes. The best known of
these collections of fables in Sanskrit is the Pañca&shy;tantra,
literally the Pentateuch, or Pentamerone. From it and from other sources
another collection was made, well known to all Sanskrit scholars by the
name of Hitopadesa, <i>i.e.</i>, Salutary Advice. Both these books have
been published in England and Germany, and there are translations of
them in English, German, French, and other languages.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIII_4" id = "tagIII_4" href = "#noteIII_4">4</a></p>

<p>The first question which we have to answer refers to the date of
these collections, and dates in the history
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
<a name = "page142" id = "page142"> </a>
of Sanskrit literature are always difficult points. Fortunately, as we
shall see, we can in this case fix the date of the Pañca&shy;tantra at
least, by means of a translation into ancient Persian, which was made
about 550 years after Christ, though even then we can only prove that a
collection somewhat like the Pañkatantra must have existed at that time;
but we cannot refer the book, in exactly that form in which we now
possess it, to that distant period.</p>

<p>If we look for La Fontaine’s fable in the Sanskrit stories of the
Pañca&shy;tantra, we do not find, indeed, the milkmaid counting her
chickens before they are hatched, but we meet with the following <span
class = "locked">story:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class = "quote">
“There lived in a certain place a Brâhman, whose name was <span class =
"sanskrit">Svabhâvakṛpaṇa</span>, which means ‘a&nbsp;born miser.’ He
had collected a quantity of rice by begging (this reminds us somewhat of
the Buddhist mendicants), and after having dined off it, he filled a pot
with what was left over. He hung the pot on a peg on the wall, placed
his couch beneath, and looking intently at it all the night, he thought,
‘Ah, that pot is indeed brimful of rice. Now, if there should be a
famine, I&nbsp;should certainly make a hundred rupees by it. With this I
shall buy a couple of goats. They will have young ones every six months,
and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats. Then, with the goats,
I&nbsp;shall buy cows. As soon as they have calved, I&nbsp;shall sell
the calves. Then, with the cows, I&nbsp;shall buy buffaloes; with the
buffaloes, mares. When the mares have foaled, I&nbsp;shall have plenty
of horses; and when I sell them, plenty of gold. With that gold I shall
get a house with four wings. And then a Brâhman will come to my house,
and will give me his beautiful daughter, with a large dowry. She will
have a son, and I shall call him Somaśarman. When he is old enough to be
danced on his father’s knee, I&nbsp;shall sit with a book at the back of
the stable, and while I am reading the boy will see me, jump from his
mother’s lap, and run towards me to be danced on my knee. He will come
too near the horse’s hoof, and, full of anger, I&nbsp;shall call to my
wife, “Take the baby; take him!” But she, distracted by some domestic
work does not hear me. Then I get up, and give her
<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
<a name = "page143" id = "page143"> </a>
such a kick with my foot.’ While he thought this, he gave a kick with
his foot, and broke the pot. All the rice fell over him, and made him
quite white. Therefore, I&nbsp;say, ‘He who makes foolish plans for the
future will be white all over, like the father of Somaśarman.’”<a class
= "tag" name = "tagIII_5" id = "tagIII_5" href = "#noteIII_5">5</a></p>

<p>I shall at once proceed to read you the same story, though slightly
modified, from the Hitopadeśa.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_6" id =
"tagIII_6" href = "#noteIII_6">6</a> The Hitopadeśa professes to be
taken from the Pañca&shy;tantra and some other books; and in this case
it would seem as if some other authority had been followed. You will
see, at all events, how much freedom there was in telling the old story
of the man who built castles in the air.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“In the town of <span class = "sanskrit">Devîkoṭṭa</span> there lived a
Brâhman of the name of Devaśarman. At the feast of the great equinox he
received a plate full of rice. He took it, went into a potter’s shop,
which was full of crockery, and, overcome by the heat, he lay down in a
corner and began to doze. In order to protect his plate of rice, he kept
a stick in his hand, and began to think, ‘Now, if I sell this plate of
rice, I&nbsp;shall receive ten cowries (kapardaka). I&nbsp;shall then,
on the spot, buy pots and plates, and after having increased my capital
again and again, I&nbsp;shall buy and sell betel nuts and dresses till I
become enormously rich. Then I shall marry four wives, and the youngest
and prettiest of the four I shall make a great pet of. Then the other
wives will be so angry, and begin to quarrel. But I shall be in a great
rage, and take a stick, and give them a good flogging.’
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. While he said this, he flung his stick away; the
plate of rice was smashed to pieces, and many of the pots in the shop
were broken. The potter, hearing the noise, ran into the shop, and when
he saw his pots broken, he gave the Brâhman a good scolding, and drove
him out of his shop. Therefore I say, ‘He who rejoices over plans for
the future will come to grief, like the Brâhman who broke the
pots.’”</p>

<p>In spite of the change of a Brahman into a milkmaid, no one,
I&nbsp;suppose, will doubt that we have here
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
<a name = "page144" id = "page144"> </a>
in the stories of the Pañca&shy;tantra and Hitopadeśa the first germs of
La Fontaine’s fable.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_7" id = "tagIII_7"
href = "#noteIII_7">7,</a><a class = "tag" href = "#chapIII_noteA">A</a>
But how did that fable travel all the way from India to France? How did
it doff its Sanskrit garment and don the light dress of modern French?
How was the stupid Brahman born again as the brisk milkmaid,
“<i>cotillon simple et souliers plats</i>?”</p>

<p>It seems a startling case of longevity that while languages have
changed, while works of art have perished, while empires have risen and
vanished again, this simple children’s story should have lived on, and
maintained its place of honor and its undisputed sway in every
school-room of the East and every nursery of the West. And yet it is a
case of longevity so well attested that even the most skeptical would
hardly venture to question it. We have the passport of these stories
<i>viséed</i> at every place through which they have passed, and, as far
as I can judge, <i>parfaitement en règle</i>. The story of the migration
of these Indian fables from East to West is indeed wonderful; more
wonderful and more instructive than many of these fables themselves.
Will it be believed that we, in this Christian country and in the
nineteenth century, teach our children the first, the most important
lessons of worldly wisdom, nay, of a more than worldly wisdom, from
books borrowed from Buddhists and Brahmans, from heretics and idolaters,
and that wise words, spoken a thousand, nay, two thousand years ago, in
a lonely village of India, like precious seed scattered broadcast all
over the world, still bear fruit a hundred and a thousand-fold in that
soil which is the most precious before God and man, the soul of a child?
No lawgiver, no philosopher,
<span class = "pagenum">145</span>
<a name = "page145" id = "page145"> </a>
has made his influence felt so widely, so deeply, and so permanently as
the author of these children’s fables. But who was he? We do not know.
His name, like the name of many a benefactor of the human race, is
forgotten. We only know he was an Indian&mdash;a nigger, as some people
would call him&mdash;and that he lived at least two thousand years
ago.</p>

<p>No doubt, when we first hear of the Indian origin of these fables,
and of their migration from India to Europe, we wonder whether it can be
so; but the fact is, that the story of this Indo-European migration is
not, like the migration of the Indo-European languages, myths, and
legends, a&nbsp;matter of theory, but of history, and that it was never
quite forgotten either in the East or in the West. Each translator, as
he handed on his treasure, seems to have been anxious to show how he
came by it.</p>

<p>Several writers who have treated of the origin and spreading of
Indo-European stories and fables, have mixed up two or three questions
which ought to be treated each on its own merits.</p>

<p>The first question is whether the Aryans, when they broke up their
pro-ethnic community, carried away with them, not only their common
grammar and dictionary, but likewise some myths and legends which we
find that Indians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Celts, Germans, Slaves,
when they emerge into the light of history, share in common? That
certain deities occur in India, Greece, and Germany, having the same
names and the same character, is a fact that can no longer be denied.
That certain heroes, too, known to Indians, Greeks, and Romans, point to
one and the same origin, both by their name and by their
<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
<a name = "page146" id = "page146"> </a>
history, is a fact by this time admitted by all whose admission is of
real value. As heroes are in most cases gods in disguise, there is
nothing very startling in the fact that nations, who had worshipped the
same gods, should also have preserved some common legends of demi-gods
or heroes, nay, even in a later phase of thought, of fairies and ghosts.
The case, however, becomes much more problematical when we ask, whether
stories also, fables told with a decided moral purpose, formed part of
that earliest Aryan inheritance? This is still doubted by many who have
no doubts whatever as to common Aryan myths and legends, and even those
who, like myself, have tried to establish by tentative arguments the
existence of common Aryan fables, dating from before the Aryan
separation, have done so only by showing a possible connection between
ancient popular saws and mythological ideas, capable of a moral
application. To any one, for instance, who knows how in the poetical
mythology of the Aryan tribes, the golden splendor of the rising sun
leads to conceptions of the wealth of the Dawn in gold and jewels and
her readiness to shower them upon her worshippers, the modern German
proverb, <i>Morgenstunde hat Gold im Munde</i>, seems to have a kind of
mythological ring, and the stories of benign fairies, changing
everything into gold, sound likewise like an echo from the
long-forgotten forest of our common Aryan home. If we know how the trick
of dragging stolen cattle backwards into their place of hiding, so that
their footprints might not lead to the discovery of the thief, appears
again and again in the mythology of different Aryan nations, then the
pointing of the same trick as a kind of proverb, intended to convey a
moral lesson,
<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
<a name = "page147" id = "page147"> </a>
and illustrated by fables of the same or a very similar character in
India and Greece, makes one feel inclined to suspect that here too the
roots of these fables may reach to a pro-ethnic period. <i>Vestigia
nulla retrorsum</i> is clearly an ancient proverb, dating from a nomadic
period, and when we see how Plato (“Alcibiades,” i. 123) was perfectly
familiar with the Æsopian myth or fable,&mdash;<span class = "greek"
title = "kata ton Aisôpou muthon">κατὰ τὸν Αἰσώπου μῦθον</span>, he
says&mdash;of the fox declining to enter the lion’s cave, because all
footsteps went into it and none came out, and how the Sanskrit
Pañca&shy;tantra (III.&nbsp;14) tells of a jackal hesitating to enter
his own cave, because he sees the footsteps of a lion going in, but not
coming out, we feel strongly inclined to admit a common origin for both
fables. Here, however, the idea that the Greeks, like La Fontaine, had
borrowed their fable from the Pañca&shy;tantra would be simply absurd,
and it would be much more rational, if the process must be one of
borrowing, to admit, as Benfey (“Pantschatantra,” i. 381) does, that the
Hindus, after Alexander’s discovery of India, borrowed this story from
the Greeks. But if we consider that each of the two fables has its own
peculiar tendency, the one deriving its lesson from the absence of
backward footprints of the victims, the other from the absence of
backward footprints of the lion himself, the admission of a common Aryan
proverb such as “<i>vestigia nulla retrorsum</i>” would far better
explain the facts such as we find them. I&nbsp;am not ignorant of the
difficulties of this explanation, and I would myself point to the fact
that among the Hottentots, too, Dr. Bleek has found a fable of the
jackal declining to visit the sick lion, “because the traces of the
animals
<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
<a name = "page148" id = "page148"> </a>
who went to see him did not turn back.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIII_8" id = "tagIII_8" href = "#noteIII_8">8</a> Without, however,
pronouncing any decided opinion on this vexed question, what I wish to
place clearly before you is this, that the spreading of Aryan myths,
legends, and fables, dating from a pro-ethnic period, has nothing
whatever to do with the spreading of fables taking place in strictly
historical times from India to Arabia, to Greece and the rest of Europe,
not by means of oral tradition, but through more or less faithful
translations of literary works. Those who like may doubt whether
<i>Zeus</i> was <em>Dyaus</em>, whether <i>Daphne</i> was
<em>Ahanâ</em>, whether <i>La Belle au Bois</i> was the mother of two
children, called <i>L’Aurore</i> and <i>Le Jour</i>,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIII_9" id = "tagIII_9" href = "#noteIII_9">9</a> but the fact
that a collection of fables was, in the sixth century of our era,
brought from India to Persia, and by means of various translations
naturalized among Persians, Arabs, Greeks, Jews, and all the rest,
admits of no doubt or cavil. Several thousand years have passed between
those two migrations, and to mix them up together, to suppose that
Comparative Mythology has anything to do with the migration of such
fables as that of Perrette, would be an anachronism of a portentous
character.</p>

<p>There is a third question, viz., whether besides the two channels
just mentioned, there were others through which Eastern fables could
have reached Europe, or Æsopian and other European fables have been
transferred to the East. There are such channels, no doubt. Persian and
Arab stories, of Indian origin, were through the crusaders brought back
to Constantinople, Italy, and France; Buddhist fables
<span class = "pagenum">149</span>
<a name = "page149" id = "page149"> </a>
were through Mongolian<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_10" id =
"tagIII_10" href = "#noteIII_10">10</a> conquerors (13th century)
carried to Russia and the eastern parts of Europe. Greek stories may
have reached Persia and India at the time of Alexander’s conquests and
during the reigns of the Diadochi, and even Christian legends may have
found their way to the East through missionaries, travellers, or
slaves.</p>

<p>Lastly, there comes the question, how far our common human nature is
sufficient to account for coincidences in beliefs, customs, proverbs,
and fables, which, at first sight, seem to require an historical
explanation. I&nbsp;shall mention but one instance. Professor Wilson
(“Essays on Sanskrit Literature,” i. p.&nbsp;201) pointed out that the
story of the Trojan horse occurs in a Hindu tale, only that instead of
the horse we have an elephant. But he rightly remarked that the
coincidence was accidental. In the one case, after a siege of nine
years, the principal heroes of the Greek army are concealed in a wooden
horse, dragged into Troy by a stratagem, and the story ends by their
falling upon the Trojans and conquering the city of Priam. In the other
story a king bent on securing a son-in-law, had an elephant constructed
by able artists, and filled with armed men. The elephant was placed in a
forest, and when the young prince came to hunt, the armed men sprang
out, overpowered the prince and brought him to the king, whose daughter
he was
<span class = "pagenum">150</span>
<a name = "page150" id = "page150"> </a>
to marry. However striking the similarity may seem to one unaccustomed
to deal with ancient legends, I&nbsp;doubt whether any comparative
mythologist has postulated a common Aryan origin for these two stories.
They feel that, as far as the mere construction of a wooden animal is
concerned, all that was necessary to explain the origin of the idea in
one place was present also in the other, and that while the Trojan horse
forms an essential part of a mythological cycle, there is nothing truly
mythological or legendary in the Indian story. The idea of a hunter
disguising himself in the skin of an animal, or even of one animal
assuming the disguise of another,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_11" id
= "tagIII_11" href = "#noteIII_11">11</a> are familiar in every part of
the world, and if that is so, then the step from hiding under the skin
of a large animal to that of hiding in a wooden animal is not very
great.</p>

<p>Every one of these questions, as I said before, must be treated on
its own merits, and while the traces of the first migration of Aryan
fables can be rediscovered
<span class = "pagenum">151</span>
<a name = "page151" id = "page151"> </a>
only by the most minute and complex inductive processes, the documents
of the latter are to be found in the library of every intelligent
collector of books. Thus, to return to Perrette and the fables of
Pilpay, Huet, the learned bishop of Avranches, the friend of La
Fontaine, had only to examine the prefaces of the principal translations
of the Indian fables in order to track their wanderings, as he did in
his famous “Traite de l’Origine des Romans,” published at Paris in 1670,
two years after the appearance of the first collection of La Fontaine’s
fables. Since his time the evidence has become more plentiful, and the
whole subject has been more fully and more profoundly treated by
Sylvestre de Sacy,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_12" id = "tagIII_12"
href = "#noteIII_12">12</a> Loiseleur Deslongchamps,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIII_13" id = "tagIII_13" href = "#noteIII_13">13</a> and
Professor Benfey.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_14" id = "tagIII_14"
href = "#noteIII_14">14</a> But though we have a more accurate knowledge
of the stations by which the Eastern fables reached their last home in
the West, Bishop Huet knew as well as we do that they came originally
from India through Persia by way of Bagdad and Constantinople.</p>

<p>In order to gain a commanding view of the countries traversed by
these fables, let us take our position at Bagdad in the middle of the
eighth century, and watch from that central point the movements of our
literary caravan in its progress from the far East to the far West. In
the middle of the eighth century, during the reign of the great Khalif
Almansur, Abdallah ibn Almokaffa wrote his famous collection of fables,
the “Kalila and Dimnah,” which we still possess.
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
<a name = "page152" id = "page152"> </a>
The Arabic text of these fables has been published by Sylvestre de Sacy,
and there is an English translation of it by Mr. Knatchbull, formerly
Professor of Arabic at Oxford. Abdallah ibn Almokaffa was a Persian by
birth, who after the fall of the Omeyyades became a convert to
Mohammedanism, and rose to high office at the court of the Khalifs.
Being in possession of important secrets of state, he became dangerous
in the eyes of the Khalif Almansur, and was foully murdered.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIII_15" id = "tagIII_15" href = "#noteIII_15">15</a> In
the preface, Abdallah ibn Almokaffa tells us that he translated these
fables from Pehlevi, the ancient language of Persia; and that they had
been translated into Pehlevi (about two hundred years before his time)
by Barzûyeh, the physician of Khosru Nushirvan, the King of Persia, the
contemporary of the Emperor Justinian. The King of Persia had heard that
there existed in India a book full of wisdom, and he had commanded his
Vezier, Buzurjmihr, to find a man acquainted with the languages both of
Persia and India. The man chosen was Barzûyeh. He travelled to India,
got possession of the book, translated it into Persian, and brought it
back to the court of Khosru. Declining all rewards beyond a dress of
honor, he only stipulated that an account of his own life and opinions
should be added to the book. This account, probably written by himself,
is extremely curious. It is a kind of <i>Religio Medici</i> of the sixth
century, and shows us a soul dissatisfied with traditions and
formularies, striving after truth, and finding rest only where many
other seekers after truth have found rest before and after him, in a
life devoted to alleviating the sufferings of mankind.</p>

<p>There is another account of the journey of this
<span class = "pagenum">153</span>
<a name = "page153" id = "page153"> </a>
Persian physician to India. It has the sanction of Firdúsi, in the great
Persian epic, the Shah Nâmeh, and it is considered by some<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIII_16" id = "tagIII_16" href = "#noteIII_16">16</a> as
more original than the one just quoted. According to it, the Persian
physician read in a book that there existed in India trees or herbs
supplying a medicine with which the dead could be restored to life. At
the command of the king he went to India in search of those trees and
herbs; but, after spending a year in vain researches, he consulted some
wise people on the subject. They told him that the medicine of which he
had read as having the power of restoring men to life had to be
understood in a higher and more spiritual sense, and that what was
really meant by it were ancient books of wisdom preserved in India,
which imparted life to those who were dead in their folly and sins.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIII_17" id = "tagIII_17" href =
"#noteIII_17">17</a> Thereupon the physician translated these books, and
one of them was the collection of fables, the “Kalila and Dimnah.”</p>

<p>It is possible that both these stories were later inventions; the
preface also by Ali, the son of Alshah Farési, in which the names of
Bidpai and King Dabshelim are mentioned for the first time, is of later
date. But the fact remains that Abdallah ibn Almokaffa, the author of
the oldest Arabic collection of our fables, translated them from
Pehlevi, the language of Persia at the time of Khosru Nushirvan, and
that the Pehlevi text which he translated was believed to be a
translation of a book brought from India in the middle of the sixth
century. That Indian book could not have been the Pañca&shy;tantra, as
we now possess it, but must have been a much larger collection of
fables,
<span class = "pagenum">154</span>
<a name = "page154" id = "page154"> </a>
for the Arabic translation, the “Kalilah and Dimnah,” contains eighteen
chapters instead of the five of the Pañca&shy;tantra, and it is only in
the fifth, the seventh, the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth chapters
that we find the same stories which form the five books of the
Pañkatantra in the <i>textus ornatior</i>. Even in these chapters the
Arabic translator omits stories which we find in the Sanskrit text, and
adds others which are not to be found there.</p>

<p>In this Arabic translation the story of the Brahman and the pot of
rice runs as <span class = "locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class = "quote">
“A religious man was in the habit of receiving every day from the house
of a merchant a certain quantity of butter (oil) and honey, of which,
having eaten as much as he wanted, he put the rest into a jar, which he
hung on a nail in a corner of the room, hoping that the jar would in
time be filled. Now, as he was leaning back one day on his couch, with a
stick in his hand, and the jar suspended over his head, he thought of
the high price of butter and honey, and said to himself, ‘I&nbsp;will
sell what is in the jar, and buy with the money which I obtain for it
ten goats, which, producing each of them a young one every five months,
in addition to the produce of the kids as soon as they begin to bear, it
will not be long before there is a large flock.’ He continued to make
his calculations, and found that he should at this rate, in the course
of two years, have more than four hundred goats. ‘At the expiration of
this term I will buy,’ said he, ‘a&nbsp;hundred black cattle, in the
proportion of a bull or a cow for every four goats. I&nbsp;will then
purchase land, and hire workmen to plough it with the beasts, and put it
into tillage, so that before five years are over I shall, no doubt, have
realized a great fortune by the sale of the milk which the cows will
give, and of the produce of my land. My next business will be to build a
magnificent house, and engage a number of servants, both male and
female; and, when my establishment is completed, I&nbsp;will marry the
handsomest woman I can find, who, in due time becoming a mother, will
present me with an heir to my possessions, who, as he advances in age,
shall receive the best masters that can be procured; and, if the
progress which he makes
<span class = "pagenum">155</span>
<a name = "page155" id = "page155"> </a>
in learning is equal to my reasonable expectations, I&nbsp;shall be
amply repaid for the pains and expense which I have bestowed upon him;
but if, on the other hand, he disappoints my hopes, the rod which I have
here shall be the instrument with which I will make him feel the
displeasure of a justly-offended parent.’ At these words he suddenly
raised the hand which held the stick towards the jar, and broke it, and
the contents ran down upon his head and face.”<a class = "tag" name =

<p>You will have observed the coincidences between the Arabic and the
Sanskrit versions, but also a considerable divergence, particularly in
the winding up of the story. The Brahman and the holy man both build
their castles in the air; but, while the former kicks his wife, the
latter only chastises his son. How this change came to pass we cannot
tell. One might suppose that, at the time when the book was translated
from Sanskrit into Pehlevi, or from Pehlevi into Arabic, the Sanskrit
story was exactly like the Arabic story, and that it was changed
afterwards. But another explanation is equally admissible, viz., that
the Pehlevi or the Arabic translator wished to avoid the offensive
behavior of the husband kicking his wife, and therefore substituted the
son as a more deserving object of castigation.</p>

<p>We have thus traced our story from Sanskrit to Pehlevi, and from
Pehlevi to Arabic; we have followed it in its migrations from the
hermitages of Indian sages to the court of the kings of Persia, and from
thence to the residence of the powerful Khalifs at Bagdad. Let us
recollect that the Khalif Almansur, for whom the Arabic translation was
made, was the contemporary of Abderrhaman, who ruled in Spain, and that
both were but little anterior to Harun

al Rashid and Charlemagne. At that time, therefore, the way was
perfectly open for these Eastern fables, after they had once reached
Bagdad, to penetrate into the seats of Western learning, and to spread
to every part of the new empire of Charlemagne. They may have done so,
for all we know; but nearly three hundred years pass before these fables
meet us again in the literature of Europe. The Carlovingian empire had
fallen to pieces, Spain had been rescued from the Mohammedans, William
the Conqueror had landed in England, and the Crusades had begun to turn
the thoughts of Europe towards the East, when, about the year 1080, we
hear of a Jew of the name of Symeon, the son of Seth, who translated
these fables from Arabic into Greek. He states in his preface that the
book came originally from India, that it was brought to the King
Chosroes of Persia, and then translated into Arabic. His own translation
into Greek must have been made from an Arabic MS. of the “Kalila and
Dimna,” in some places more perfect, in others less perfect, than the
one published by De Sacy. The Greek text has been published, though very
imperfectly, under the title of “Stephanites and Ichnelates.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIII_19" id = "tagIII_19" href = "#noteIII_19">19</a>
Here our fable is told as follows <span class =
"locked">(p.&nbsp;337):&mdash;</span></p>

<p class = "quote">
“It is said that a beggar kept some honey and butter in a jar close to
where he slept. One night he thus thought within himself: ‘I&nbsp;shall
sell this honey and butter for however small a sum; with it I shall buy
ten goats, and these in five months will produce as many again. In five
years they will become four hundred. With them I shall buy one hundred
cows, and with them I shall cultivate some land. And what with their
calves
<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<a name = "page157" id = "page157"> </a>
and the harvests, I&nbsp;shall become rich in five years, and build a
house with four wings,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_20" id =
"tagIII_20" href = "#noteIII_20">20</a> ornamented with gold, and buy
all kinds of servants, and marry a wife. She will give me a child, and I
shall call him Beauty. It will be a boy, and I shall educate him
properly; and if I see him lazy, I&nbsp;shall give him such a flogging
with this stick.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ With these words he took a
stick that was near him, struck the jar, and broke it, so that the honey
and milk ran down on his beard.”</p>

<p>This Greek translation might, no doubt, have reached La Fontaine; but
as the French poet was not a great scholar, least of all a reader of
Greek MSS., and as the fables of Symeon Seth were not published till
1697, we must look for other channels through which the old fable was
carried along from East to West.</p>

<p>There is, first of all, an Italian translation of the “Stephanites
and Ichnelates,” which was published at Ferrara in 1583.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIII_21" id = "tagIII_21" href = "#noteIII_21">21,</a><a class

Agarena nella Greca da Simeone Setto, philosopho Antiocheno. Et hora
tradotti di Greco in Italiano.” This translation was probably the work
of Giulio Nuti.</p>

<p>There is, besides, a Latin translation, or rather a free rendering of
the Greek translation by the learned Jesuit, Petrus Possinus, which was
published at Rome in 1666.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_22" id =
"tagIII_22" href = "#noteIII_22">22,</a><a class = "tag" href =
"#chapIII_noteC">C</a> This may have been, and, according to some
authorities, has really been one of the sources from which La Fontaine
drew his inspirations. But though La Fontaine may have consulted this
work
<span class = "pagenum">158</span>
<a name = "page158" id = "page158"> </a>
for other fables, I&nbsp;do not think that he took from it the fable of
Perrette and the milk-pail.</p>

<p>The fact is, these fables had found several other channels through
which, as early as the thirteenth century, they reached the literary
market of Europe, and became familiar as household words, at least among
the higher and educated classes. We shall follow the course of some of
these channels. First, then, a&nbsp;learned Jew, whose name seems to
have been Joel, translated our fables from Arabic into Hebrew (1250?).
His work has been preserved in one MS. at Paris, but has not yet been
published, except the tenth book, which was communicated by Dr. Neubauer
to Benfey’s journal, “Orient und Occident” (vol.&nbsp;i. p.&nbsp;658).
This Hebrew translation was translated by another converted Jew,
Johannes of Capua, into Latin. His translation was finished between
1263&ndash;1278, and, under the title of “Directorium Humanæ Vitæ,” it
became very soon a popular work with the select reading public of the
thirteenth century.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_23" id = "tagIII_23"
href = "#noteIII_23">23,</a><a class = "tag" href =
"#chapIII_noteD">D</a> In the “Directorium,” and in Joel’s translation,
the name of Sendebar is substituted for that of Bidpay. The
“Directorium” was translated into German at the command of Eberhard, the
great Duke of Würtemberg,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_24" id =
"tagIII_24" href = "#noteIII_24">24,</a><a class = "tag" href =
"#chapIII_noteE">E</a> and both the Latin text and the German
translation occur, in repeated editions, among the rare books printed
between 1480 and the end of the fifteenth century.<a class = "tag" name
= "tagIII_25" id = "tagIII_25" href = "#noteIII_25">25</a>
A&nbsp;Spanish translation, founded both on the German and the Latin
texts, appeared at Burgos in 1493;<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_26" id
= "tagIII_26" href = "#noteIII_26">26</a> and from these different
sources flowed in the sixteenth century the Italian
<span class = "pagenum">159</span>
<a name = "page159" id = "page159"> </a>
renderings of Firenzuola (1548)<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_27" id =

name = "tagIII_28" id = "tagIII_28" href = "#noteIII_28">28</a> As these
Italian translations were repeated in French<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIII_29" id = "tagIII_29" href = "#noteIII_29">29</a> and English,
before the end of the sixteenth century, they might no doubt have
supplied La Fontaine with subjects for his fables.</p>

<p>But, as far as we know, it was a third channel that really brought
the Indian fables to the immediate notice of the French poet.
A&nbsp;Persian poet, of the name of Nasr Allah, translated the work of
Abdallah ibn Almokaffa into Persian about 1150. This Persian translation
was enlarged in the fifteenth century by another Persian poet, Husain
ben Ali called el Vaez, under the title of “Anvári Suhaili.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIII_30" id = "tagIII_30" href = "#noteIII_30">30</a>
This name will be familiar to many members of the Indian Civil Service,
as being one of the old Haileybury class-books which had to be construed
by all who wished to gain high honors in Persia. This work, or
<span class = "pagenum">160</span>
<a name = "page160" id = "page160"> </a>
at least the first books of it, were translated into French by David
Sahid of Ispahan, and published at Paris in 1644, under the title of
“Livre des Lumières, ou, la Conduite des Rois, composé par le Sage
Pilpay, Indien.” This translation, we know, fell into the hands of La
Fontaine, and a number of his most charming fables were certainly
borrowed from it.</p>

<p>But Perrette with the milk-pail has not yet arrived at the end of her
journey, for if we look at the “Livre des Lumières,” as published at
Paris, we find neither the milkmaid nor her prototype, the Brahman who
kicks his wife, or the religious man who flogs his boy. That story
occurs in the later chapters, which were left out in the French
translation; and La Fontaine, therefore, must have met with his model
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Remember that in all our wanderings we have not yet found the
milkmaid, but only the Brahman or the religious man. What we want to
know is who first brought about this metamorphosis.</p>

<p>No doubt La Fontaine was quite the man to seize on any jewel which
was contained in the Oriental fables, to remove the cumbersome and
foreign-looking setting, and then to place the principal figure in that
pretty frame in which most of us have first become acquainted with it.
But in this case the charmer’s wand did not belong to La Fontaine, but
to some forgotten worthy, whose very name it will be difficult to fix
upon with certainty.</p>

<p>We have, as yet, traced three streams only, all starting from the
Arabic translation of Abdallah ibn Almokaffa, one in the eleventh,
another in the twelfth, a&nbsp;third in the thirteenth century, all
reaching Europe,
<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
<a name = "page161" id = "page161"> </a>
some touching the very steps of the throne of Louis XIV., yet none of
them carrying the leaf which contained the story of “Perrette,” or of
the “Brahman,” to the threshold of La Fontaine’s home. We must,
therefore, try again.</p>

<p>After the conquest of Spain by the Mohammedans, Arabic literature had
found a new home in Western Europe, and among the numerous works
translated from Arabic into Latin or Spanish, we find towards the end of
the thirteenth century (1289) a&nbsp;Spanish translation of our fables,
called “Calila é Dymna.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_31" id =
"tagIII_31" href = "#noteIII_31">31,</a><a class = "tag" href =
"#chapIII_noteF">F</a> In this the name of the philosopher is changed
from Bidpai to Bundobel. This, or another translation from Arabic, was
turned into Latin verse by Raimond de Béziers in 1313 (not
published).</p>

<p>Lastly, we find in the same century another translation from Arabic
straight into Latin verse, by Baldo, which became known under the name
of “Æsopus alter.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_32" id = "tagIII_32"
href = "#noteIII_32">32,</a><a class = "tag" href =
"#chapIII_noteG">G</a></p>

<p>From these frequent translations, and translations of translations,
in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, we see quite clearly
that these Indian fables were extremely popular, and were, in fact, more
widely read in Europe than the Bible, or any other book. They were not
only read in translations, but having been introduced into sermons,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIII_33" id = "tagIII_33" href =
"#noteIII_33">33,</a><a class = "tag" href = "#chapIII_noteH">H</a>
homilies, and works on morality, they were improved upon, acclimatized,
localized, moralized, till at last it is almost impossible to recognize
their Oriental features under their homely disguises.</p>

<p>I shall give you one instance only.</p>

<p>Rabelais, in his “Gargantua,” gives a long description how a man
might conquer the whole world. At
<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
<a name = "page162" id = "page162"> </a>
the end of this dialogue, which was meant as a satire on Charles V., we
<span class = "locked">read:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class = "quote">
“There was there present at that time an old gentleman well experienced
in the wars, a&nbsp;stern soldier, and who had been in many great
hazards, named Echephron, who, hearing this discourse, said: ‘J’ay grand
peur que toute ceste entreprise sera semblable à la farce <i>du pot au
laict</i> duquel un cordavanier se faisoit riche par resverie, puis le
pot cassé, n’eut de quoy disner.’”</p>

<p>This is clearly our story, only the Brahman has, as yet, been changed
into a shoemaker only, and the pot of rice or the jar of butter and
honey into a pitcher of milk. Now it is perfectly true that if a writer
of the fifteenth century changed the Brahman into a shoemaker, La
Fontaine might, with the same right, have replaced the Brahman by his
milkmaid. Knowing that the story was current, was, in fact, common
property in the fifteenth century, nay, even at a much earlier date, we
might really be satisfied after having brought the germs of “Perrette”
within easy reach of La Fontaine. But, fortunately, we can make at least
one step further, a&nbsp;step of about two centuries. This step
backwards brings us to the thirteenth century, and there we find our old
Indian friend again, and this time really changed into a milkmaid. The
book I refer to is written in Latin, and is called, “Dialogus
Creaturarum optime moralizatus;” in English, the “Dialogue of Creatures
moralized.” It was a book intended to teach the principles of Christian
morality by examples taken from ancient fables. It was evidently a most
successful book, and was translated into several modern languages. There
is an old translation of it in English, first printed by Rastell,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIII_34" id = "tagIII_34" href =
"#noteIII_34">34</a> and
<span class = "pagenum">163</span>
<a name = "page163" id = "page163"> </a>
afterwards repeated in 1816. I&nbsp;shall read you from it the fable in
which, as far as I can find, the milkmaid appears for the first time on
the stage, surrounded already by much of that scenery which, four
hundred years later, received its last touches at the hand of La
Fontaine.</p>

<p>Here we have arrived at the end of our journey. It has been a long
journey across fifteen or twenty centuries, and I am afraid our
following Perrette from country to country, and from language to
language, may have tired some of my hearers. I&nbsp;shall, therefore,
not attempt to fill the gap that divides the fable of the thirteenth
century from La Fontaine. Suffice it to say, that the milkmaid, having
once taken the place of the Brahman, maintained it against all comers.
We find her as Dona Truhana, in the famous “Conde Lucanor,” the work of
the Infante Don Juan Manuel,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_36" id =

<p>You see now before your eyes the bridge on which our fables came to
us from East to West. The same bridge which brought us Perrette brought
us hundreds of fables, all originally sprung up in India, many of them
carefully collected by Buddhist priests, and preserved in their sacred
canon, afterwards handed on to the Brahminic writers of a later age,
carried by Barzûyeh from India to the court of
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
<a name = "page166" id = "page166"> </a>
Persia, then to the courts of the Khalifs at Bagdad and Cordova, and of
the emperors at Constantinople. Some of them, no doubt, perished on
their journey, others were mixed up together, others were changed till
we should hardly know them again. Still, if you once know the eventful
journey of Perrette, you know the journey of all the other fables that
belong to this Indian cycle. Few of them have gone through so many
changes, few of them have found so many friends, whether in the courts
of kings or in the huts of beggars. Few of them have been to places
where Perrette has not also been. This is why I selected her and her
passage through the world as the best illustration of a subject which
otherwise would require a whole course of lectures to do it justice.</p>

<p>But though our fable represents one large class or cluster of fables,
it does not represent all. There were several collections, besides the
Pancatantra, which found their way from India to Europe. The most
important among them is the “Book of the Seven Wise Masters, or the Book
of Sindbad,” the history of which has lately been written, with great
learning and ingenuity, by Signor Comparetti.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIII_38" id = "tagIII_38" href = "#noteIII_38">38</a></p>

<p>These large collections of fables and stories mark what may be called
the high roads on which the literary products of the East were carried
to the West. But there are, beside these high roads, some smaller, less
trodden paths on which single fables, sometimes mere proverbs, similes,
or metaphors, have come to us from India, from Persepolis, from Damascus
and Bagdad. I&nbsp;have already alluded to the powerful influence which
Arabic literature exercised on Western Europe through Spain. Again,
a&nbsp;most
<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
<a name = "page167" id = "page167"> </a>
active interchange of Eastern and Western ideas took place at a later
time during the progress of the Crusades. Even the inroads of Mongolian
tribes into Russia and the East of Europe kept up a literary bartering
between Oriental and Occidental nations.</p>

<p>But few would have suspected a Father of the Church as an importer of
Eastern fables. Yet so it is.</p>

<p>At the court of the same Khalif Almansur, where Abdallah ibn
Almokaffa translated the fables of Calila and Dimna from Persian into
Arabic, there lived a Christian of the name of Sergius, who for many
years held the high office of treasurer to the Khalif. He had a son to
whom he gave the best education that could then be given, his chief
tutor being one Cosmas, an Italian monk, who had been taken prisoner by
the Saracens, and sold as a slave at Bagdad. After the death of Sergius,
his son succeeded him for some time as chief councillor (<span class =
"greek" title = "prôtosumboulos">πρωτοσύμβουλος</span>) to the Khalif
Almansur. Such, however, had been the influence of the Italian monk on
his pupil’s mind, that he suddenly resolved to retire from the world,
and to devote himself to study, meditation, and pious works. From the
monastery of St. Saba, near Jerusalem, this former minister of the
Khalif issued the most learned works on theology, particularly his
“Exposition of the Orthodox Faith.” He soon became the highest authority
on matters of dogma in the Eastern Church, and he still holds his place
among the saints both of the Eastern and Western Churches. His name was
Joannes, and from being born at Damascus, the former capital of the
Khalifs, he is best known in history as Joannes Damascenus, or St. John
of Damascus. He must
<span class = "pagenum">168</span>
<a name = "page168" id = "page168"> </a>
have known Arabic, and probably Persian; but his mastery of Greek earned
him, later in life, the name of Chrysorrhoas, or Gold-flowing. He became
famous as the defender of the sacred images, and as the determined
opponent of the Emperor Leo the Isaurian, about 726. It is difficult in
his life to distinguish between legend and history, but that he had held
high office at the court of the Khalif Almansur, that he boldly opposed
the iconoclastic policy of the Emperor Leo, and that he wrote the most
learned theological works of his time, cannot be easily questioned.</p>

<p>Among the works ascribed to him is a story called “Barlaam and
Joasaph.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_39" id = "tagIII_39" href =
"#noteIII_39">39</a> There has been a fierce controversy as to whether
he was the author of it or not. Though for our own immediate purposes it
would be of little consequence whether the book was written by Joannes
Damascenus or by some less distinguished ecclesiastic, I&nbsp;must
confess that the arguments hitherto adduced against his authorship seem
to me very weak.</p>

<p>The Jesuits did not like the book, because it was
<span class = "pagenum">169</span>
<a name = "page169" id = "page169"> </a>
a religious novel. They pointed to a passage in which the Holy Ghost is
represented as proceeding from the Father “and the Son,” as incompatible
with the creed of an Eastern ecclesiastic. That very passage, however,
has now been proved to be spurious; and it should be borne in mind,
besides, that the controversy on the procession of the Holy Ghost from
the Father and the Son, or from the Father through the Son, dates a
century later than Joannes. The fact, again, that the author does not
mention Mohammedanism,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_40" id =
"tagIII_40" href = "#noteIII_40">40</a> proves nothing against the
authorship of Joannes, because, as he places Barlaam and Joasaph in the
early centuries of Christianity, he would have ruined his story by any
allusion to Mohammed’s religion, then only a hundred years old. Besides,
he had written a separate work, in which the relative merits of
Christianity and Mohammedanism are discussed. The prominence given to
the question of the worship of images shows that the story could not
have been written much before the time of Joannes Damascenus, and there
is nothing in the style of our author that could be pointed out as
incompatible with the style of the great theologian. On the contrary,
the author of “Barlaam and Joasaph” quotes the same authors whom Joannes
Damascenus quotes most frequently&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Basilius and
Gregorius Nazianzenus. And no one but Joannes could have taken long
passages from his own works without saying where he borrowed them.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIII_41" id = "tagIII_41" href =
"#noteIII_41">41</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum">170</span>
<a name = "page170" id = "page170"> </a>
<p>The story of “Barlaam and Joasaph”&mdash;or, as he is more commonly
called, Josaphat&mdash;may be told in a few words: “A&nbsp;king in
India, an enemy and persecutor of the Christians, has an only son. The
astrologers have predicted that he would embrace the new doctrine. His
father, therefore, tries by all means in his power to keep him ignorant
of the miseries of the world, and to create in him a taste for pleasure
and enjoyment. A&nbsp;Christian hermit, however, gains access to the
prince, and instructs him in the doctrines of the Christian religion.
The young prince is not only baptized, but resolves to give <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘up / up’ at line break">up</ins> all
his earthly riches; and after having converted his own father and many
of his subjects, he follows his teacher into the desert.”</p>

<p>The real object of the book is to give a simple exposition of the
principal doctrines of the Christian religion. It also contains a first
attempt at comparative theology, for in the course of the story there is
a disputation on the merits of the principal religions of the
world&mdash;the Chaldæan, the Egyptian, the Greek, the Jewish, and the
Christian. But one of the chief attractions of this manual of Christian
theology consisted in a number of fables and parables with which it is
enlivened. Most of them have been traced to an Indian source.
I&nbsp;shall mention one only which has found its way into almost every
literature of the <span class = "locked">world:<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIII_42" id = "tagIII_42" href =
"#noteIII_42">42</a>&mdash;</span></p>

<p class = "quote">
“A man was pursued by a unicorn, and while he tried to flee from it, he
fell into a pit. In falling he stretched out both his
<span class = "pagenum">171</span>
<a name = "page171" id = "page171"> </a>
arms, and laid hold of a small tree that was growing on one side of the
pit. Having gained a firm footing, and holding to the tree, he fancied
he was safe, when he saw two mice, a&nbsp;black and a white one, busy
gnawing the root of the tree to which he was clinging. Looking down into
the pit, he perceived a horrid dragon with his mouth wide open, ready to
devour him, and when examining the place on which his feet rested, the
heads of four serpents glared at him. Then he looked up, and observed
drops of honey falling down from the tree to which he clung. Suddenly
the unicorn, the dragon, the mice, and the serpents were all forgotten,
and his mind was intent only on catching the drops of sweet honey
trickling down from the tree.”</p>

<p>An explanation is hardly required. The unicorn is Death, always
chasing man; the pit is the world; the small tree is man’s life,
constantly gnawed by the black and the white mouse&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, by
night and day; the four serpents are the four elements which compose the
human body; the dragon below is meant for the jaws of hell. Surrounded
by all those horrors, man is yet able to forget them all, and to think
only of the pleasures of life, which, like a few drops of honey, fall
into his mouth from the tree of life.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_43"
id = "tagIII_43" href = "#noteIII_43">43</a></p>

<p>But what is still more curious is, that the author of “Barlaam and
Josaphat” has evidently taken his very hero, the Indian Prince Josaphat,
from an Indian source. In the “Lalita Vistara”&mdash;the life, though no
doubt the legendary life, of Buddha&mdash;the father of Buddha is a
king. When his son is born, the Brahman Asita predicts that he will rise
to great glory, and become either a powerful king, or, renouncing the
throne and embracing the life of a hermit
<span class = "pagenum">172</span>
<a name = "page172" id = "page172"> </a>
become a Buddha.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_44" id = "tagIII_44"
href = "#noteIII_44">44</a> The great object of his father is to prevent
this. He therefore keeps the young prince, when he grows up, in his
garden and palaces, surrounded by all pleasures which might turn his
mind from contemplation to enjoyment. More especially he is to know
nothing of illness, old age, and death, which might open his eyes to the
misery and unreality of life. After a time, however, the prince receives
permission to drive out; and then follow the four drives,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIII_45" id = "tagIII_45" href = "#noteIII_45">45</a> so
famous in Buddhist history. The places where these drives took place
were commemorated by towers still standing in the time of Fa Hian’s
visit to India, early in the fifth century after Christ, and even in the
time of Hiouen Thsang, in the seventh century. I&nbsp;shall read you a
short account of the three <span class = "locked">drives:<a class =

“One day when the prince with a large retinue was driving through the
eastern gate of the city, on the way to one of his parks, he met on the
road an old man, broken and decrepit. One could see the veins and
muscles over the whole of his body, his teeth chattered, he was covered
with wrinkles, bald, and hardly able to utter hollow and unmelodious
sounds. He was bent on his stick, and all his limbs and joints trembled.
‘Who is that man?’ said the prince to his coachman. ‘He is small and
weak, his flesh and his blood are dried up, his muscles stick to his
skin, his head is white, his teeth chatter, his body is wasted away;
leaning on his stick, he is hardly able to walk, stumbling at every
step. Is there something peculiar in his family, or is this the common
lot of all created beings?’</p>

<p class = "quote">
“‘Sir,’ replied the coachman, ‘that man is sinking under old age, his
senses have become obtuse, suffering has destroyed his strength, and he
is despised by his relations. He is without support and useless, and
people have abandoned him, like a dead tree in a forest. But this is not
peculiar to his family.

<a name = "page173" id = "page173"> </a>
In every creature youth is defeated by old age. Your father, your
mother, all your relations, all your friends, will come to the same
state; this is the appointed end of all creatures.’</p>

<p class = "quote">
“‘Alas!’ replied the prince, <ins class = "correction" title = "text has “ for ‘">‘are</ins> creatures so ignorant, so weak and foolish as to be
proud of the youth by which they are intoxicated, not seeing the old age
which awaits them? As for me, I&nbsp;go away. Coachman, turn my chariot

with pleasure<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ” for ’">?’</ins> And the young prince returned to the city without going to
the park.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Another time the prince was driving through the southern gate to his
pleasure-garden, when he perceived on the road a man suffering from
illness, parched with fever, his body wasted, covered with mud, without
a friend, without a home, hardly able to breathe, and frightened at the
sight of himself, and the approach of death. Having questioned his
coachman, and received from him the answer which he expected, the young
prince said, ‘Alas! health is but the sport of a dream, and the fear of
suffering must take this frightful form. Where is the wise man who,
after having seen what he is, could any longer think of joy and
pleasure?’ The prince turned his chariot, and returned to the city.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“A third time he was driving to his pleasure-garden through the western
gate, when he saw a dead body on the road, lying on a bier and covered
with a cloth. The friends stood about crying, sobbing, tearing their
hair, covering their heads with dust, striking their breasts, and
uttering wild cries. The prince, again, calling his coachman to witness
this painful scene, exclaimed, ‘Oh, woe to youth, which must be
destroyed by old age! Woe to health, which must be destroyed by so many
diseases! Woe to this life, where a man remains so short a time! If
there were no old age, no disease, no death; if these could be made
captive forever!’ Then, betraying for the first time his intentions, the
young prince said, ‘Let us turn back, I&nbsp;must think how to
accomplish deliverance.’</p>

<p class = "quote">
“A last meeting put an end to hesitation. He was driving through the
northern gate on the way to his pleasure-gardens, when he saw a
mendicant, who appeared outwardly calm, subdued, looking downwards,
wearing with an air of dignity his religious vestment, and carrying an
alms-bowl.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“‘Who is that man?’ asked the prince.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">174</span>
<a name = "page174" id = "page174"> </a>
<p class = "quote">
“‘Sir,’ replied the coachman, ‘this man is one of those who are called
Bhikshus, or mendicants. He has renounced all pleasures, all desires,
and leads a life of austerity. He tries to conquer himself. He has
become a devotee. Without passion, without envy, he walks about asking
for alms.’</p>

<p class = "quote">
“‘This is good and well said,’ replied the prince. ‘The life of a
devotee has always been praised by the wise. It will be my refuge, and
the refuge of other creatures; it will lead us to a real life, to
happiness and immortality.’</p>

<p class = "quote">
“With these words the young prince turned his chariot, and returned to
the city.”</p>

<p>If we now compare the story of Joannes of Damascus, we find that the
early life of Josaphat is exactly the same as that of Buddha. His father
is a king, and after the birth of his son, an astrologer predicts that
he will rise to glory; not, however, in his own kingdom, but in a higher
and better one; in fact, that he will embrace the new and persecuted
religion of the Christians. Everything is done to prevent this. He is
kept in a beautiful palace, surrounded by all that is enjoyable; and
great care is taken to keep him in ignorance of sickness, old age, and
death. After a time, however, his father gives him leave to drive out.
On one of his drives he sees two men, one maimed, the other blind. He
asks what they are, and is told that they are suffering from disease. He
then inquires whether all men are liable to disease, and whether it is
known beforehand who will suffer from disease and who will be free; and
when he hears the truth, he becomes sad, and returns home. Another time,
when he drives out, he meets an old man with wrinkled face and shaking
legs, bent down, with white hair, his teeth gone, and his voice
faltering. He asks again what all this means, and is told that this is
what happens
<span class = "pagenum">175</span>
<a name = "page175" id = "page175"> </a>
to all men; and that no one can escape old age, and that in the end all
men must die. Thereupon he returns home to meditate on death, till at
last a hermit appears,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_47" id =
"tagIII_47" href = "#noteIII_47">47</a> and opens before his eyes a
higher view of life, as contained in the Gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>No one, I believe, can read these two stories without feeling
convinced that one was borrowed from the other; and as Fa Hian, three
hundred years before John of Damascus, saw the towers which commemorated
the three drives of Buddha still standing among the ruins of the royal
city of Kapilavastu, it follows that the Greek father borrowed his
subject from the Buddhist scriptures. Were it necessary, it would be
easy to point out still more minute coincidences between the life of
Josaphat and of Buddha, the founder of the Buddhist religion. Both in
the end convert their royal fathers, both fight manfully against the
assaults of the flesh and the devil, both are regarded as saints before
they die. Possibly even a proper name may have been transferred from the
sacred canon of the Buddhists to the pages of the Greek writer. The
driver who conducts Buddha when he flees by night from his palace where
he leaves his wife, his only son, and all his treasures, in order to
devote himself to a contemplative life, is called Chandaka, in Burmese,
Sanna.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_48" id = "tagIII_48" href =
"#noteIII_48">48</a> The friend and companion of Barlaam is called
Zardan.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_49" id = "tagIII_49" href =
"#noteIII_49">49</a> Reinaud
<span class = "pagenum">176</span>
<a name = "page176" id = "page176"> </a>
in his “Mémoire sur l’Inde,” p.&nbsp;91 (1849), was the first, it seems,
to point out that Youdasf, mentioned by Massoudi as the founder of the
Sabæan religion, and Youasaf, mentioned as the founder of Buddhism by
the author of the “Kitáb-al-Fihrist,” are both meant for Bodhisattva,
a&nbsp;corruption quite intelligible with the system of transcribing
that name with Persian letters. Professor Benfey has identified Theudas,
the sorcerer in “Barlaam and Joasaph,” with the Devadatta of the
Buddhist scriptures.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_50" id = "tagIII_50"
href = "#noteIII_50">50</a></p>

<p>How palpable these coincidences are between the two stories is best
shown by the fact that they were pointed out, independently of each
other, by scholars in France, Germany, and England. I&nbsp;place France
first, because in point of time M. Laboulaye was the first who called
attention to it in one of his charming articles in the “Debats.”<a class
= "tag" name = "tagIII_51" id = "tagIII_51" href = "#noteIII_51">51</a>
A&nbsp;more detailed comparison
<span class = "pagenum">177</span>
<a name = "page177" id = "page177"> </a>
was given by Dr. Liebrecht.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_52" id =
"tagIII_52" href = "#noteIII_52">52</a> And, lastly, Mr. Beal, in his
translation of the “Travels of Fa Hian,”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIII_53" id = "tagIII_53" href = "#noteIII_53">53</a> called
attention to the same fact&mdash;viz., that the story of Josaphat was
borrowed from the “Life of Buddha.” I&nbsp;could mention the names of
two or three scholars besides who happened to read the two books, and
who could not help seeing, what was as clear as daylight, that Joannes
Damascenus took the principal character of his religious novel from the
“Lalita Vistara,” one of the sacred books of the Buddhists; but the
merit of having been the first belongs to M.&nbsp;Laboulaye.</p>

<p>This fact is, no doubt, extremely curious in the history of
literature; but there is another fact connected with it which is more
than curious, and I wonder that it has never been pointed out before. It
is well known that the story of “Barlaam and Josaphat” became a most
popular book during the Middle Ages. In the East it was translated into
Syriac(?), Arabic, Ethiopic, Armenian, and Hebrew; in the West it exists
in Latin, French, Italian, German, English, Spanish, Bohemian, and
Polish. As early as 1204, a&nbsp;King of Norway translated it into
Icelandic, and at a later time it was translated by a Jesuit missionary
into Tagala, the classical language of the Philippine Islands. But this
is not all, Barlaam and Josaphat have actually risen to the rank of
saints, both in the Eastern and in the Western <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘chuches’">churches</ins>. In the Eastern church the
26th of August is the saints’ day of Barlaam and Josaphat; in the
<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
<a name = "page178" id = "page178"> </a>
Roman Martyrologium, the 27th of November is assigned to them.</p>

<p>There have been from time to time misgivings about the historical
character of these two saints. Leo Allatius, in his “Prolegomena,”
ventured to ask the question, whether the story of “Barlaam and
Josaphat” was more real than the “Cyropædia” of Xenophon, or the
“Utopia” of Thomas More; but, <i>en bon Catholique</i>, he replied, that
as Barlaam and Josaphat were mentioned, not only in the Menæa of the
Greek, but also in the Martyrologium of the Roman Church, he could not
bring himself to believe that their history was imaginary. Billius
thought that to doubt the concluding words of the author, who says that
he received the story of “Barlaam and Josaphat” from men incapable of
falsehood, would be to trust more in one’s own suspicions than in
Christian charity, which believeth all things. Bellarminus thought he
could prove the truth of the story by the fact that, at the end of it,
the author himself invokes the two saints Barlaam and Josaphat! Leo
Allatius admitted, indeed, that some of the speeches and conversations
occurring in the story might be the work of Joannes Damascenus, because
Josaphat, having but recently been converted, could not have quoted so
many passages from the Bible. But he implies that even this could be
explained, because the Holy Ghost might have taught St. Josaphat what to
say. At all events, Leo has no mercy for those “quibus omnia sub
sanctorum nomine prodita male olent, quemadmodum de sanctis Georgio,
Christophoro, Hippolyto, Catarina, aliisque nusquam eos in rerum natura
extitisse impudentissime nugantur.” The Bishop of Avranches had likewise
his doubts;
<span class = "pagenum">179</span>
<a name = "page179" id = "page179"> </a>
but he calmed them by saying: “Non pas que je veuille soustenir que tout
en soit supposé: il y auroit de la témerité à desavouer qu’il y ait
jamais eû de Barlaam ni de Josaphat. Le témoignage du Martyrologe, qui
les met au nombre des Saints, et leur intercession que Saint Jean
Damascene reclame à la fin de cette histoire ne permettent pas d’en
douter.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_54" id = "tagIII_54" href =
"#noteIII_54">54</a></p>

<p>With us the question as to the historical or purely imaginary
character of Josaphat has assumed a new and totally different aspect. We
willingly accept the statement of Joannes Damascenus that the story of
“Barlaam and Josaphat” was told him by men who came from India. We know
that in India a story was current of a prince who lived in the sixth
century <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, a prince of whom it was
predicted that he would resign the throne, and devote his life to
meditation, in order to rise to the rank of a Buddha. The story tells us
that his father did everything to prevent this; that he kept him in a
palace secluded from the world, surrounded by all that makes life
enjoyable; and that he tried to keep him in ignorance of sickness, old
age, and death. We know from the same story that at last the young
prince obtained permission to drive into the country, and that, by
meeting an old man, a&nbsp;sick man, and a corpse, his eyes were opened
to the unreality of life, and the vanity of this life’s pleasures; that
he escaped from his palace, and, after defeating the assaults of all
adversaries, became the founder of a new religion. This is the story, it
may be the legendary story, but at all events the recognized story of
Gautama <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘S{â}kyamuni’">Śâkyamuni</ins>, best known to us under the name of
Buddha.</p>

<p>If, then, Joannes Damascenus tells the same story,
<span class = "pagenum">180</span>
<a name = "page180" id = "page180"> </a>
only putting the name of Joasaph or Josaphat, <i>i.e.</i>, Bodhisattva,
in the place of Buddha; if all that is human and personal in the life of
St. Josaphat is taken from the “Lalita Vistara”&mdash;what follows? It
follows that, in the same sense in which La Fontaine’s Perrette is the
Brahman of the Pañca&shy;tantra, St. Josaphat is the Buddha of the
Buddhist canon. It follows that Buddha has become a saint in the Roman
Church; it follows that, though under a different name, the sage of
Kapilavastu, the founder of a religion which, whatever we may think of
its dogma, is, in the purity of its morals, nearer to Christianity than
any other religion, and which counts even now, after an existence of
2,400 years, 455,000,000 of believers, has received the highest honors
that the Christian Church can bestow. And whatever we may think of the
sanctity of saints, let those who doubt the right of Buddha to a place
among them read the story of his life as it is told in the Buddhist
canon. If he lived the life which is there described, few saints have a
better claim to the title than Buddha; and no one either in the Greek or
in the Roman Church need be ashamed of having paid to Buddha’s memory
the honor that was intended for St. Josaphat, the prince, the hermit,
and the saint.</p>

<p>History, here as elsewhere, is stranger than fiction; and a kind
fairy, whom men call Chance, has here, as elsewhere, remedied the
ingratitude and injustice of the world.</p>

<div class = "notes">

<p><span class = "firstword">I am</span> enabled to add here a short
account of an important discovery made by Professor Benfey with regard
to the Syriac translation of our Collection of Fables. Doubts had been
expressed by Sylvestre de Sacy and others, as to the existence of this
translation, which was mentioned for the first time in Ebedjesu’s
catalogue of Syriac writers published by Abraham Ecchellensis, and again
later by Assemani (“Biblioth. Orient.,” tom. iii. part 1, p.&nbsp;219).
M.&nbsp;Renan, on the contrary, had shown that the title of this
translation, as transmitted to us, “Kalilag and Damnag,” was a guarantee
of its historical authenticity. As a final k in Pehlevi becomes h in
modern Persian, a&nbsp;title such as “Kalilag and Damnag,” answering to
“Kalilak and Damnak” in Pehlevi, in Sanskrit “<span class =
"sanskrit">Karaṭaka and Damanaka</span>,” could only have been borrowed
from the Persian before the Mohammedan era. Now that the interesting
researches of Professor Benfey on this subject have been rewarded by the
happy discovery of a Syriac translation, there remains but one point to
be cleared up, viz., whether this is really the translation made by Bud
Periodeutes, and whether this same translation was made, as Ebedjesu
affirms, from the Indian text, or, as M.&nbsp;Renan supposes, from a
Pehlevi version. I&nbsp;insert the account which Professor Benfey
himself gave of his discovery in the Supplement to the “Allgemeine
Zeitung” of July 12, 1871, and I may add that both text and translation
are nearly ready for publication (1875).</p>

<p>The account I am about to give will recall the novel of our
celebrated compatriot Freytag (“Die verlorene Handschrift,”
<span class = "pagenum">182</span>
<a name = "page182" id = "page182"> </a>
or “The Lost&nbsp;MS.”), but with this essential difference, that we are
not here treating of a creation of the imagination, but of a real fact;
not of the MS. of a work of which many other copies exist, but of an
unique specimen; in short, of the MS. of a work which, on the faith of
one single mention, was believed to have been composed thirteen
centuries ago. This mention, however, appeared to many critical scholars
so untrustworthy, that they looked upon it as the mere result of
confusion. Another most important difference is, that this search, which
has lasted three years, has been followed by the happiest results: it
has brought to light a MS. which, even in this century, rich in
important discoveries, deserves to be ranked as of the highest value. We
have acquired in this MS. the oldest specimen preserved to our days of a
work, which, as translated into various languages, has been more widely
disseminated and has had a greater influence on the development of
civilization than any other work, excepting the Bible.</p>

<p>But to the point.</p>

<p>Through the researches, which I have published in my edition of the
Pantschatantra,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_55" id = "tagIII_55" href
= "#noteIII_55">55</a> it is known that about the sixth century of our
era, a&nbsp;work existed in India, which treated of deep political
questions under the form of fables, in which the actors were animals. It
contained various chapters, but these subdivisions were not, as had been
hitherto believed, eleven to thirteen in number, but, as the MS. just
found shows most clearly, there were at least twelve, perhaps thirteen
or fourteen. This work was afterwards so entirely altered in India, that
five of these divisions were separated from the other six or nine, and
much enlarged, whilst the remaining ones were entirely set aside. This
apparently curtailed, but really enlarged edition
<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
<a name = "page183" id = "page183"> </a>
of the old work, is the Sanskrit book so well known as the
Pantschatantra, “The Five Books.” It soon took the place, on its native
soil, of the old work, causing the irreparable loss of the latter in
India.</p>

<p>But before this change of the old work had been effected in its own
land, it had, in the first half of the sixth century, been carried to
Persia, and translated into Pehlevi under King Chosru Nuschirvan
(531&ndash;579). According to the researches which I have described in
my book already quoted, the results of which are fully confirmed by the
newly discovered MS., it cannot be doubted that, if this translation had
been preserved, we should have in it a faithful reproduction of the
original Indian work, from which, by various modifications, the
Pantschatantra is derived. But unfortunately this Pehlevi translation,
like its Indian original, is irretrievably lost.</p>

<p>But it is known to have been translated into Arabic in the eighth
century by a native of Persia, by name Abdallah ibn Almokaffa
(d.&nbsp;760), who had embraced Islamism, and it acquired, partly in
this language, partly in translations and retranslations from it (apart
from the recensions in India, which penetrated to East, North, and South
Asia,) that extensive circulation which has caused it to exercise the
greatest influence on civilization in Western Asia, and throughout
Europe.</p>

<p>Besides this translation into Pehlevi, there was, according to one
account, another, also of the sixth century, in Syriac. This account we
owe to a Nestorian writer, who lived in the thirteenth century. He
mentions in his catalogue of authors<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_56"
id = "tagIII_56" href = "#noteIII_56">56</a> a&nbsp;certain Bud
Periodeutes, who probably about 570 had to inspect the Nestorian
communities in Persia and India, and who says that, in addition to other
books which he names, “he translated the book ‘Qalîlag and Damnag’ from
the Indian.”</p>

<p>Until three years ago, not the faintest trace of this old
<span class = "pagenum">184</span>
<a name = "page184" id = "page184"> </a>
Syrian translation was to be found, and the celebrated Orientalist,
Silvestre de Sacy, in the historical memoir which he prefixed to his
edition of the Arabic translation, “Calila and Dimna” (Paris, 1816),
thought himself justified in seeing in this mention a mere confusion
between Barzûyeh, the Pehlevi translator, and a Nestorian Monk.</p>

<p>The first trace of this Syriac version was found in May, 1868. On the
sixth of that month, Professor Bickell of Münster, the diligent promoter
of Syrian philology, wrote to tell me that he had heard from a Syrian
Archdeacon from Urumia, Jochannân bar Bâbisch, who had visited Münster
in the spring to collect alms, and had returned there again in May,
that, some time previously, several Chaldæan priests who had been
visiting the Christians of St. Thomas in India, had brought back with
them some copies of this Syriac translation, and had given them to the
Catholic Patriarch in Elkosh (near Mossul). He had received one of
these.</p>

<p>Though the news appeared so unbelievable and the character of the
Syrian priest little calculated to inspire confidence in his statements,
it still seemed to me of sufficient importance for me to ask my friends
to make further inquiries in India, where other copies ought still to be
in existence. Even were the result but a decided negative, it would be a
gain to science. These inquiries had no effect in proving the truth of
the archdeacon’s assertions; but, at the same time, they did not
disprove them. It would of course have been more natural to make
inquiries among the Syrians. But from want of friends and from other
causes, which I shall mention further on, I&nbsp;could hardly hope for
any certain results, and least of all, that if the MS. really existed,
I&nbsp;could obtain it, or a copy of it.</p>

<p>The track thus appeared to be lost, and not possible to be followed
up, when, after the lapse of nearly two years, Professor Bickell, in a
letter of February 22, 1870, drew my attention to the fact that the
Chaldæan Patriarch, Jussuf Audo, who, according to Jochannân bar
Bâbisch, was in
<span class = "pagenum">185</span>
<a name = "page185" id = "page185"> </a>
possession of that translation, was now in Rome, as member of the
Council summoned by the Pope.</p>

<p>Through Dr. Schöll of Weimar, then in Rome, and one Italian savant,
Signor Ignazio Guidi, I&nbsp;was put into communication with the
Patriarch, and with another Chaldæan priest, Bishop Qajjât, and received
communications, the latest of June 11, 1870, which indeed proved the
information of Jochannân bar Bâbisch to be entirely untrustworthy; but
at the same time pointed to the probable existence of a MS. of the
Syriac translation at Mardîn.</p>

<p>I did not wait for the last letters, which might have saved the
discoverer much trouble, but might also have frustrated the whole
inquiry; but, as soon as I had learnt the place where the MS. might be,
I&nbsp;wrote; May 6, 1870, exactly two years after the first trace of
the MS. had been brought to light, to my former pupil and friend, Dr.
Albert Socin of Basle, who was then in Asia on a scientific expedition,
begging him to make the most careful inquiries in Mardîn about this MS.,
and especially to satisfy himself whether it had been derived from the
Arabian translation, or was independent of and older than the latter. We
will let Dr. Socin, the discoverer of the MS., tell us himself of his
efforts and their results.</p>

<p>“I received your letter of May 6, 1870, a few days ago, by Bagdad and
Mossul, at Yacho on the Chabôras. You say that you had heard that the
book was in the library at Mardîn. I&nbsp;must own that I doubted
seriously the truth of the information, for Oriental Christians always
say that they possess every possible book, whilst in reality they have
but few. I&nbsp;found this on my journey through the ‘Christian
Mountain,’ the Tûr el’ ’Abedîn, where I visited many places and
monasteries but little known. I&nbsp;only saw Bibles in Estrangelo
character, which were of value, nowhere profane books; but the people
are so fanatical, and watch their books so closely, that it is very
difficult to get sight of <ins class = "correction" title = "invisible hyphen at line break">anything</ins>; and one has to keep them in good
humor. Unless after a long sojourn, and with the aid of bribery, there
can
<span class = "pagenum">186</span>
<a name = "page186" id = "page186"> </a>
never be any thought of buying anything from a monastic library. Arrived
in Mardîn, I&nbsp;set myself to discover the book. I&nbsp;naturally
passed by all Moslem libraries, as Syriac books only exist among the
Christians. I&nbsp;settled at first that the library in question could
only be the Jacobite Cloister, ‘Der ez Zàferân,’ the most important
centre of the Christians of Mardîn. I&nbsp;therefore sent to the
Patriarch of Diarbekir for most particular introductions, and started
for ‘Der ez Zàferân,’ which lies in the mountains, 5½ hours from Mardîn.
The recommendations opened the library to me. I&nbsp;looked through four
hundred volumes, without finding anything; there was not much of any
value. On my return to Mardîn, I&nbsp;questioned people right and left;
no one knew anything about it. At length I summoned up courage one day,
and went to the Chaldæan monastery. The different sects in Mardîn are
most bitter against each other, and as I unfortunately lodged in the
house of an American missionary, it was very difficult for me to gain
access to these Catholics, who were unknown to me. Luckily my servant
was a Catholic, and could state that I had no proselytizing schemes.
After a time I asked about their books; Missals and Gospels were placed
before me; I&nbsp;asked if they had any books of Fables. ‘Yes, there was
one there.’ After a long search in the dust, it was found and brought to
me. I&nbsp;opened it, and saw at the first glance, in red letters,
‘Qalîlag and Damnag,’ with the old termination g, which proved to me
that the work was not translated from the Arabic ‘Calila ve Dimnah.’ You
may be certain that I did not show what I felt. I&nbsp;soon laid the
book quietly down. I&nbsp;had indeed before asked the monk specially for
‘Kalila and Dimna,’ and with some persistency, before I inquired
generally for books of fables; but he had not the faintest suspicion
that the book before him was the one so eagerly sought after. After
about a week or ten days, in order to arouse no suspicion, I&nbsp;sent a
trustworthy man to borrow the book; but he was asked at once if it were
for the ‘Fréngi den Prot’ (Protestant), and my
<span class = "pagenum">187</span>
<a name = "page187" id = "page187"> </a>
confidant was so good as to deny it, ‘No, it was for himself.’
I&nbsp;then examined the book more carefully. Having it safely in my
possession, I&nbsp;was not alarmed at the idea of a little hubbub.
I&nbsp;therefore made inquiries, but in all secret, whether they would
sell it. ‘No, never,’ was the answer I expected and received, and the
idea that I had borrowed it for myself was revived. I&nbsp;therefore
began to have a copy made. But I was obliged to leave Mardîn and even
the neighboring Diarbekir, before I received the copy. In Mardîn itself
the return of the book was loudly demanded, as soon as they knew I was
having it copied. I&nbsp;was indeed delighted when, through the kindness
of friends, <i>post tot discrimina rerum</i> I received the book at
Aleppo.”</p>

<p>So far writes my friend, the fortunate discoverer, who, as early as
the 19th of August, 1870, announced in a letter the happy recovery of
the book. On April 20, 1871, he kindly sent it to me from Basle.</p>

<p>This is not the place to descant on the high importance of this
discovery. It is only necessary to add that there is not the least doubt
that it has put us in possession of the old Syriac translation, of which
Ebedjesu speaks. There is only one question still to be settled, whether
it is derived direct from the Indian, or through the Pehlevi
translation? In either case it is the oldest preserved rendering of the
original, now lost in India, and therefore of priceless value.</p>

<p>The fuller treatment of this and other questions, which spring from
this discovery, will find a place in the edition of the text, with
translation and commentary, which Professor Bickell is preparing in
concert with Dr. Hoffman and myself.</p>

chickens. The chickens will be fit to carry to market about Christmas,
when poultry always bear a good price; so that by May-day I shall have

<p>Alnasker was a very idle fellow, that would never set his hand to
work during his father’s life. When his father died he left him to the
value of a hundred pounds in Persian money. In order to make the best of
it he laid it out in glasses and bottles, and the finest china. These he
piled up in a large open basket at his feet, and leaned his back upon
the wall of his shop in the
<span class = "pagenum">190</span>
<a name = "page190" id = "page190"> </a>
hope that many people would come in to buy. As he sat in this posture,
with his eyes upon the basket, he fell into an amusing train of thought,
and talked thus to himself: “This basket,” says he, “cost me a hundred
pounds, which is all I had in the world. I&nbsp;shall quickly make two
hundred of it by selling in retail. These two hundred shall in course of
trade rise to ten thousand, when I will lay aside my trade of a
glass-man, and turn a dealer in pearls and diamonds, and all sorts of
rich stones. When I have got as much wealth as I can desire, I&nbsp;will
purchase the finest house I can find, with lands, slaves, and horses.
Then I shall set myself on the footing of a prince, and will ask the
grand Vizier’s daughter to be my wife. As soon as I have married her,
I&nbsp;will buy her ten black servants, the youngest and best that can
be got for money. When I have brought this princess to my house,
I&nbsp;shall take care to breed her in due respect for me. To this end I
shall confine her to her own rooms, make her a short visit, and talk but
little to her. Her mother will then come and bring her daughter to me,
as I am seated on a sofa. The daughter, with tears in her eyes, will
fling herself at my feet, and beg me to take her into my favor. Then
will I, to impress her with a proper respect for my person, draw up my
leg, and spurn her from me with my foot in such a manner that she shall
fall down several paces from the sofa.” Alnasker was entirely absorbed
with his ideas, and could not forbear acting with his foot what he had
in his thoughts; so that, striking his basket of brittle ware, which was
the foundation of all his grand hopes, he kicked his glasses to a great
distance into the street, and broke them into a thousand
pieces.&mdash;“<i>Spectator.</i>” (From the “Sixth Book,” published by

market carrying a pot of honey on her head. On her way she began to
think that she would sell the pot of honey, and buy a quantity of eggs,
that from those eggs she would have chickens, that she would sell them
and buy sheep; that the sheep would give her lambs, and thus calculating
all her gains, she began to think herself much richer than her
neighbors. With the riches which she imagined she possessed, she thought
how she would marry her sons and daughters, and how she would walk in
the street surrounded by her sons and daughters-in-law; and how people
would consider her happy for having amassed so large a fortune, though
she had been so poor. While she was thinking over all this, she began to
laugh for joy, and struck her head and forehead with her hand. The pot
of honey fell down, was broken, and she shed hot tears because she had
lost all that she would have possessed if the pot of honey had not been

assumed the lion’s skin without the lion’s courage. The proverb <span
class = "greek" title = "onos para Kumaious">ὄνος παρὰ Κυμαίους</span>
seems to be applied to men boasting before people who have no means of
judging. It presupposes the story of a donkey appearing in a lion’s
skin.</p>

<p class = "continue">
A similar idea is expressed in a fable of the Pañca&shy;tantra
(IV.&nbsp;8) where a dyer, not being rich enough to feed his donkey,
puts a tiger’s skin on him. In this disguise the donkey is allowed to
roam through all the corn-fields without being molested, till one day he
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘see’">sees</ins>
a&nbsp;female donkey, and begins to bray. Thereupon the owners of the
field kill him.</p>

<p class = "continue">
In the Hitopadeśa (III. 3) the same fable occurs, only that there it is
the keeper of the field who on purpose disguises himself as a
she-donkey, and when he hears the tiger bray, kills him.</p>

<p class = "continue">
In the Chinese Avadânas, translated by Stanislas Julien (vol. ii.
p.&nbsp;59), the donkey takes a lion’s skin and frightens everybody,
till he begins to bray, and is recognized as a donkey.</p>

<p class = "continue">
In this case it is again quite clear that the Greeks did not borrow
their fable and proverb from the Pañca&shy;tantra; but it is not so easy
to determine positively whether the fable was carried from the Greeks to
the East, or whether it arose independently in two places.</p>

In some places one might almost believe that Joannes Damascenus did not
only hear the story of Buddha, as he says, from the mouth of people who
had brought it to him from India, but that he had before him the very
text of the <i>Lalita Vistara</i>. Thus in the account of the three or
four drives we find indeed that the Buddhist canon represents Buddha as
seeing on three successive drives, first an old, then a sick, and at
last a dying man, while Joannes makes Joasaph meet two men on his first
drive, one maimed, the other blind, and an old man, who is nearly dying,
on his second drive. So far there is a difference which might best be
explained by admitting the account given by Joannes Damascenus himself,
viz: that the story was brought from India, and that it was simply told
him by worthy and truthful men. But, if it was so, we have here another
instance of the tenacity with which oral tradition is able to preserve
the most minute points of the story. The old man is described by a long
string of adjectives both in Greek and in Sanskrit, and many of them are
strangely alike. The Greek <span class = "greek" title =

<span class = "subhead">INAUGURAL LECTURE, DELIVERED IN<br>
THE IMPERIAL UNIVERSITY OF STRASSBURG, MAY 23, 1872.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword">You</span> will easily understand that, in
giving my first lecture in a German University, I&nbsp;feel some
difficulty in mastering and repressing the feelings which stir within my
heart. I&nbsp;wish to speak to you, as it becomes a teacher, with
perfect calmness, thinking of nothing but of the subject which 1 have to
treat. But here where we are gathered together to-day, in this old free
imperial town, in this University, full of the brightest recollections
of Alsatian history and German literature, even a somewhat gray-headed
German professor may be pardoned if, for some moments at least, he gives
free vent to the thoughts that are foremost in his mind. You will see,
at least, that he feels and thinks as you all feel and think, and that
in living away from Germany he has not forgotten his German language, or
lost his German heart.</p>

<p>The times in which we live are great, so great, that we can hardly
conceive them great enough; so great that we, old and young, cannot be
great and good and brave and hardworking enough, if we do not wish to
appear quite unworthy of the times in which our lot has been cast.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">200</span>

<p>We older people have lived through darker times, when to a German,
learning was the only refuge, the only comfort, the only pride; times
when there was no Germany except in our recollection, and perhaps in our
secret hopes. And those who have lived through those sadder days feel
all the more deeply the blessings of the present. We have a Germany
again, a&nbsp;united, great, and strong country; and I call this a
blessing, not only in a material sense, as giving, at last, to our homes
a real and lasting security against the inroads of our powerful
neighbors, but also in a moral sense, as placing every German under a
greater responsibility, as reminding us of our higher duties, as
inspiring us with courage and energy for the battle of the mind even
more than for the battle of the arm.</p>

<p>That blessing has cost us dear, fearfully dear, dearer than the
friends of humanity had hoped; for, proud as we may be of our victories
and our victors, let us not deceive ourselves in this, that there is in
the history of humanity nothing so inhuman, nothing that makes us so
entirely despair of the genius of mankind, nothing that bows us so low
to the very dust, as war&mdash;unless even war becomes ennobled and
sanctified, as it was with us, by the sense of duty, duty towards our
country, duty towards our town, duty towards our home, towards our
fathers and mothers, our wives and children. Thus, and thus only, can
even war become the highest and brightest of sacrifices; thus, and thus
only, may we look history straight in the face, and ask, “Who would have
acted differently?”</p>

<p>I do not speak here of politics in the ordinary sense of the
word,&mdash;nay, I&nbsp;gladly leave the groping
<span class = "pagenum">201</span>
<a name = "page201" id = "page201"> </a>
for the petty causes of the late war to the scrutiny of those foreign
statesmen who have eyes only for the infinitesimally small, but cannot,
or will not, see the powerful handiwork of Divine justice that reveals
itself in the history of nations as in the lives of individuals.
I&nbsp;speak of politics in their true and original meaning, as a branch
of ethics, as Kant has proved them to be, and from this point of view,
politics become a duty from which no one may shrink, be he young or old.
Every nation must have a conscience, like every individual;
a&nbsp;nation must be able to give to itself an account of the moral
justification of a war in which it is to sacrifice everything that is
most dear to man. And that is the greatest blessing of the late war,
that every German, however deep he may delve in his heart, can say
without a qualm or a quiver, “The German people did not wish for war,
nor for conquest. We wanted peace and freedom in our internal
development. Another nation or rather its rulers, claimed the right to
draw for us lines of the Main, if not new frontiers of the Rhine; they
wished to prevent the accomplishment of that German union for which our
fathers had worked and suffered. The German nation would gladly have
waited longer still, if thereby war could have been averted. We knew
that the union of Germany was inevitable, and the inevitable is in no
hurry. But when the gauntlet was thrown in our face, and, be it
remembered, with the acclamation of the whole French nation, then we
knew what, under Napoleonic sway, we might expect from our powerful
neighbor, and the whole German people rose as one man for defense, not
for defiance. The object of our war was peace, and a lasting peace, and
therefore now, after peace has been
<span class = "pagenum">202</span>
<a name = "page202" id = "page202"> </a>
won, after our often menaced, often violated, western frontier has been
made secure forever by bastions, such as nature only can build, it
becomes our duty to prove to the world that we Germans are the same
after as before the war, that military glory has nothing intoxicating to
us, that we want peace with all the world.”</p>

<p>You know that the world at large does not prophesy well for us. We
are told that the old and simple German manners will go, that the ideal
interests of our life will be forgotten, that, as in other countries, so
with us, our love for the True and the Beautiful will be replaced by
love of pleasure, enjoyment, and vanities. It rests with us with all our
might to confound such evil prophesies, and to carry the banner of the
German mind higher than ever. Germany can remain great only by what has
made her great&mdash;by simplicity of manners, contentment, industry,
honesty, high ideals, contempt of luxury, of display, and of vain-glory.
“<i>Non propter vitam vivendi perdere causas</i>,”&mdash; “Not for the
sake of life to lose the real objects of life,” this must be our
watchword forever, and the <i>causæ vitæ</i>, the highest objects of
life, are for us to-day, and will, I&nbsp;trust, remain for coming
generations the same as they were in the days of Lessing, of Kant, of
Schiller, and of Humboldt.</p>

<p>And nowhere, methinks, can this return to the work of peace be better
inaugurated than here in this very place, in Strassburg. It was a bold
conception to begin the building of the new temple of learning in the
very midst of the old German frontier fortress. We are summoned here, as
in the days of Nehemiah, when “the builders every one had his sword
girded by his side and so builded.” It rests
<span class = "pagenum">203</span>
<a name = "page203" id = "page203"> </a>
with us, the young as well as the old, that this bold conception shall
not fail. And therefore I could not resist the voice of my heart, or
gainsay the wish of my friends who believed that I, too, might bring a
stone, however small, to the building of this new temple of German
science. And here I am among you to try and do my best. Though I have
lived long abroad, and pitched my workshop for nearly twenty-five years
on English soil, you know that I have always remained German in heart
and mind. And this I must say for my English friends, that they esteem a
German who remains German far more than one who wishes to pass himself
off as English. An Englishman wishes every man to be what he is.
I&nbsp;am, and I always have been, a&nbsp;German living and working in
England. The work of my life, the edition of the Rig-Veda, the oldest
book of the Indian, aye, of the whole Aryan world, could be carried out
satisfactorily nowhere but in England, where the rich collections of
Oriental MSS., and the easy communications with India, offer to an
Oriental scholar advantages such as no other country can offer. That by
living and working in England I have made some sacrifices, that I have
lost many advantages which the free intercourse with German scholars in
a German university so richly offers, no one knows better than myself.
Whatever I have seen of life, I&nbsp;know of no life more perfect than
that of a German professor in a German school or university. You know
what Niebuhr thought of such a life, even though he was a Prussian
minister and ambassador at Rome. I&nbsp;must read you some of his words,
they sound so honest and sincere: “There is no more grateful, more
serene life than that of a German
<span class = "pagenum">204</span>
<a name = "page204" id = "page204"> </a>
teacher or professor, none that, through the nature of its duties and
its work, secures so well the peace of our heart and our conscience. How
many times have I deplored it with a sad heart, that I should ever have
left that path of life to enter upon a life of trouble which, even at
the approach of old age, will probably never give me lasting peace. The
office of a schoolmaster, in particular, is one of the most honorable,
and despite of all the evils which now and then disturb its ideal
beauty, it is for a truly noble heart the happiest path of life. It was
the path which I had once chosen for myself, and how I wish I had been
allowed to follow it!”</p>

<p>I could quote to you the words of another Prussian ambassador,
Bunsen. He, too, often complained with sadness that he had missed his
true path in life. He too, would gladly have exchanged the noisy hotel
of the ambassador for the quiet home of a German professor.</p>

<p>From my earliest youth it has been the goal of my life to act as a
professor in a German university, and if this dream of my youth was not
to be fulfilled in its entirety, I&nbsp;feel all the more grateful that,
through the kindness of my friends and German colleagues, I&nbsp;have
been allowed, at least once in my life, to act during the present spring
and summer as a real German professor in a German university.</p>

<p>This was in my heart, and I wanted to say it, in order that you might
know with what purpose I have come, and with what real joy I begin the
work which has brought us together to-day.</p>

<p>I shall lecture during the present term on “The Results of the
Science of Language;” but you will easily understand that to sum up in
one course of
<span class = "pagenum">205</span>
<a name = "page205" id = "page205"> </a>
lectures the results of researches which have been carried on with
unflagging industry by three generations of scholars, would be a sheer
impossibility. Besides, a&nbsp;mere detailing of results, though it is
possible, is hardly calculated to subserve the real objects of academic
teaching. You would not be satisfied with mere results: you want to know
and to understand the method by which they have been obtained. You want
to follow step by step that glorious progress of discovery which has led
us to where we stand now. What is the use of knowing the Pythagorean
problem, if we cannot prove it? What would be the use of knowing that
the French <i>larme</i> is the same as the German <i>Zähre</i> (tear),
if we could not with mathematical exactness trace every step by which
these two words have diverged till they became what they are?</p>

<p>The results of the Science of Language are enormous. There is no
sphere of intellectual activity which has not felt more or less the
influence of this new science. Nor is this to be wondered at. Language
is the organ of all knowledge, and though we flatter ourselves that we
are the lords of language, that we use it as a useful tool, and no more,
believe me there are but few who can maintain their complete
independence with respect to language, few who can say of her, <span
class = "greek" title = "Echô Laida, ouk echomai">Ἔχω Λαΐδα, οὐκ
ἔχομαι</span>. To know language historically and genetically, to be able
more particularly to follow up the growth of our technical terms to
their very roots, this is in every science the best means to keep up a
living connection between the past and the present, the only way to make
us feel the ground on which we stand.</p>

<p>Let us begin with what is nearest to us, <i>Philology</i>.
<span class = "pagenum">206</span>
<a name = "page206" id = "page206"> </a>
Its whole character has been changed as if by magic. The two classical
languages, Greek and Latin, which looked as if they had fallen from the
sky or been found behind the hedge, have now recovered their
title-deeds, and have taken their legitimate place in that old and noble
family which we call the Indo-European, the Indo-Germanic, or by a
shorter, if not a better name, the Aryan. In this way not only have
their antecedents been cleared up, but their mutual relationship, too,
has for the first time been placed in its proper light. The idea that
Latin was derived from Greek, an idea excusable in scholars of the
Scipionic period, or that Latin was a language made up of Italic, Greek,
and Pelasgic elements, a&nbsp;view that had maintained itself to the
time of Niebuhr, all this has now been shown to be a physical
impossibility. Greek and Latin stand together on terms of perfect
equality; they are sisters, like French and <span class =
"locked">Italian:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class = "verse">
<p><span class = "gap">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>“Facies non omnibus
una,</p>
<p>Nec diversa tamen qualem decet esse sororum.”</p>
</div>

<p>If it could be a scientific question which of the two is the elder
sister, Greek or Latin, Latin, I&nbsp;believe, could produce better
claims of seniority than Greek. Now, as in the modern history of
language we are able to explain many things that are obscure in French
and Italian by calling in the Provençal, the Spanish, the Portuguese,
nay, even the Wallachian and the Churwälsch, we can do the same in the
ancient history of language, and get light for many things which are
difficult and unintelligible in Greek and Latin, by consulting Sanskrit,
Zend, Gothic, Irish, and even Old Bulgarian. We can hardly form an idea
of the surprise which was occasioned
<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
<a name = "page207" id = "page207"> </a>
among the scholars of Europe by the discovery of the Aryan family of
languages, reaching with its branches from the Himalayan mountains to
the Pyrenees. Not that scholars of any eminence believed at the end of
the last century that Greek and Latin were derived from Hebrew: that
prejudice had been disposed of once for all, in Germany at least, by
Leibniz. But after that theory had been given up, no new truly
scientific theory had taken its place. The languages of the world, with
the exception of the Semitic, the family type of which was not to be
mistaken, lay scattered about as <i>disjecta membra poëtæ</i>, and no
one thought of uniting them again into one organic whole. It was the
discovery of Sanskrit which led to the reunion of the Aryan languages,
and if Sanskrit had taught us nothing else, this alone would establish
its claim to a place among the academic sciences of our century.</p>

<p>When Greek and Latin had once been restored to their true place in
the natural system of the Aryan languages, their special treatment, too,
became necessarily a different one. In grammar, for instance, scholars
were no longer satisfied to give forms and rules, and to place what was
irregular by the side of what was regular. They wished to know the
reasons of the rules as well as of the exceptions; they asked why the
forms were such as they were, and not otherwise; they required not only
a logical, but also an historical foundation of grammar. People asked
themselves for the first time, why so small a change as <i>mensa</i> and
<i>mensæ</i> could express the difference between one and many tables;
why a single letter, like <i>r</i>, could possess the charm of changing
I love, <i>amo</i>, into I am loved, <i>amor</i>. Instead of indulging
<span class = "pagenum">208</span>
<a name = "page208" id = "page208"> </a>
in general speculations on the logic of grammar, the riddles of grammar
received their solution from a study of the historical development of
language. For every language there was to be a historical grammar, and
in this way a revolution was produced in philological studies to be
compared only to the revolution produced in chemistry by the discoveries
of Lavoisier, or in geology by the theories of Lyell. For instance,
instead of attempting an explanation why the genitive singular and the
ablative plural of the first and second declensions could express rest
in a place&mdash;<i>Romæ</i>, at Rome; <i>Tarenti</i>, at Tarentum;
<i>Athenis</i>, at Athens; <i>Gabiis</i>, at Gabii&mdash;one glance at
the past history of these languages showed that these so-called
genitives were not and never had been genitives, but corresponded to the
old locatives in <i>i</i> and <i>su</i> in Sanskrit. No doubt,
a&nbsp;pupil can be made to learn anything that stands in a grammar; but
I do not believe that it can conduce to a sound development of his
intellectual powers if he first learns at school the real meaning of the
genitive and ablative, and then has to accept on trust that, somehow or
other, the same cases may express rest in a place. A&nbsp;well-known
English divine, opposed to reform in spelling, as in everything else,
once declared that the fearful orthography of English formed the best
psychological foundation of English orthodoxy, because a child that had
once been brought to believe that t-h-r-o-u-g-h sounded like “through,”
t-h-o-u-g-h like “though,” r-o-u-g-h like “rough,” would afterwards
believe anything. Be that as it may, I&nbsp;do not consider that
grammatical rules like those just quoted on the genitive and ablative,
assuming the power of the locative, are likely to strengthen the
reasoning powers of any schoolboy.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">209</span>
<a name = "page209" id = "page209"> </a>
<p>Even more pernicious to the growth of sound ideas was the study of
etymology, as formerly carried on in schools and universities.
Everything here was left to chance or to authority, and it was not
unusual that two or three etymologies of the same word had to be learnt,
as if the same word might have had more than one parent. Yet it is many
years since Otfried Müller told classical scholars that they must either
surrender the whole subject of the historical growth of language,
etymology, and grammatical morphology, or trust in these matters
entirely to the guidance of Comparative Philology. As a student at
Leipzig, I&nbsp;lived to see old Gottfried Hermann quoting the paradigms
of Sanskrit grammar in one of his last <i>Programs</i>; and Boeckh
declared in 1850, at the eleventh meeting of German philologists, that,
in the present state of the science of language, the grammar of the
classical languages cannot dispense with the coöperation of comparative
grammar. And yet there are scholars even now who would exclude the
Science of Language from schools and universities. What gigantic steps
truly scientific etymology has made in Greek and Latin, every scholar
may see in the excellent works of Curtius and Corssen. The essential
difference between the old and the new systems consists here, too, in
this, that while formerly people were satisfied if they knew, or
imagined they knew, from what source a certain word was derived, little
value is now attached to the mere etymology of a word, unless at the
same time it is possible to account, according to fixed phonetic laws,
for all the changes which a word has undergone in its passage through
Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. How far this conscientiousness may be
carried is shown by the fact
<span class = "pagenum">210</span>
<a name = "page210" id = "page210"> </a>
that the best comparative philologists decline to admit, on phonetic
grounds, the identity of such words as the Latin <i>Deus</i>, and the
Greek <span class = "greek" title = "Theos">Θεός</span>, although the
strongest internal arguments may be urged in favor of the identity of
these words.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_1" id = "tagIV_1" href =
"#noteIV_1">1,</a><a class = "tag" href = "#chapIV_noteA">A</a></p>

<p>Let us go on to <i>Mythology</i>. If mythology is an old dialect,
outliving itself, and, on the strength of its sacred character, carried
on to a new period of language, it is easy to perceive that the
historical method of the Science of Language would naturally lead here
to most important results. Take only the one fact, which no one at
present would dare to question, that the name of the highest deity among
the Greeks and Romans, <span class = "greek" title = "Zeus">Ζεύς</span>,
and <i>Jupiter</i>, is the same as the Vedic <em>Dyaus</em>, the sky,
and the old German <i>Zio</i>, Old Norse <i>Tyr</i>, whose name survives
in the modern names of <i>Dienstag</i> or <i>Tuesday</i>. Does not this
one word prove the union of those ancient races? Does it not show us, at
the earliest dawn of history, the fathers of the Aryan race, the fathers
of our own race, gathered together in the great temple of nature, like
brothers of the same house, and looking up in adoration to the sky as
the emblem of what they yearned for, a&nbsp;father and a God. Nay, can
we not hear in that old name of <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
Heaven-Father, the true key-note which still sounds on in our own
prayer, “Our Father which art in heaven,” and which imparts to these
words their deepest tone, and their fullest import? By an accurate study
of these words we are able to draw the bonds of language and belief even
more closely together. You know that the nom. sing. of <span class =
"greek" title = "Zeus">Ζεύς</span> has the acute, and so has the nom.
sing. of <em>Dyaus</em>; but the vocative of <span class = "greek" title
= "Zeus">Ζεύς</span>
<span class = "pagenum">211</span>
<a name = "page211" id = "page211"> </a>
has the circumflex, and so has likewise the vocative of <em>Dyaus</em>
in the Veda.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_2" id = "tagIV_2" href =
"#noteIV_2">2,</a><a class = "tag" href = "#chapIV_noteB">B</a> Formerly
the accent might have been considered as something late, artificial, and
purely grammatical: the Science of Language has shown that it is as old
as language itself, and it has rightly called it the very soul of words.
Thus even in these faint pulsations of language, in the changes of
accent in Greek and Sanskrit, may we feel the common blood that runs in
the veins of the old Aryan dialects.</p>

<p>History, too, particularly the most ancient history, has received new
light and life from a comparative study of languages. Nations and
languages were in ancient times almost synonymous, and what constitutes
the ideal unity of a nation lies far more in the intellectual factors,
in religion and language, than in common descent and common blood. But
for that very reason we must here be most cautious. It is but too easily
forgotten that if we speak of Aryan and Semitic families, the ground of
classification is language, and language only. There are Aryan and
Semitic languages, but it is against all rules of logic to speak,
without an expressed or implied qualification, of an Aryan race, of
Aryan blood, of Aryan skulls, and to attempt ethnological classification
on purely linguistic grounds. These two sciences, the Science of
Language and the Science of Man, cannot, at least for the present, be
kept too much asunder; and many misunderstandings, many controversies,
would have been avoided, if scholars had not attempted to draw
conclusions from language to blood, or from blood to language. When each
of these sciences shall have carried out independently its own
<span class = "pagenum">212</span>
<a name = "page212" id = "page212"> </a>
classification of men and of languages, then, and then only, will it be
time to compare their results; but even then, I&nbsp;must repeat, what I
have said many times before, it would be as wrong to speak of Aryan
blood as of dolichocephalic grammar.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_3" id
= "tagIV_3" href = "#noteIV_3">3</a></p>

<p>We have all accustomed ourselves to look for the cradle of the Aryan
languages in Asia, and to imagine these dialects flowing like streams
from the centre of Asia to the South, the West, and the North.
I&nbsp;must confess that Professor Benfey’s protest against this theory
seems to me very opportune, and his arguments in favor of a more
northern, if not European, origin of the whole Aryan family of speech,
deserve, at all events, far more attention than they have hitherto
received.</p>

<p>For the same reasons it seems to me at least a premature undertaking
to use the greater or smaller number of coincidences between two or more
of the Aryan languages as arguments in support of an earlier or later
separation of the people who spoke them. First of all, there are few
points on which the opinions of competent judges differ more decidedly
than when the exact degrees of relationship between the single Aryan
languages have to be settled. There is agreement on one point only,
viz., that Sanskrit and Zend are more closely united than any other
languages. But though on this point there can hardly be any doubt, no
satisfactory explanation of this extraordinary agreement has as yet been
given. In fact, it has been doubted whether what I called the “Southern
Division” of the Aryan family could properly be called a division at
all, as
<span class = "pagenum">213</span>
<a name = "page213" id = "page213"> </a>
it consisted only of varieties of one and the same type of Aryan speech.
As soon as we go beyond Sanskrit and Zend, the best authorities are
found to be in open conflict. Bopp maintained that the Slavonic
languages were most closely allied to Sanskrit, an opinion shared by
Pott. Grimm, on the contrary, maintained a closer relationship between
Slavonic and German. In this view he was supported by Lottner,
Schleicher, and others, while Bopp to the last opposed it. After this,
Schleicher (as,&nbsp;before him, Newman in England) endeavored to prove
a closer contact between Celtic and Latin, and, accepting Greek as most
closely united with Latin, he proceeded to establish a Southwestern
European division, consisting of Celtic, Latin, and Greek, and running
parallel with the Northwestern division, consisting of Teutonic and
Slavonic; or, according to Ebel, of Celtic, Teutonic, and Slavonic.</p>

<p>But while these scholars classed Greek with Latin, others, such as
Grassmann and Sonne, pointed out striking peculiarities which Greek
shares with Sanskrit, and with Sanskrit only, as, for instance, the
augment, the voiceless aspirates, the <i>alpha privativum</i>
(a,&nbsp;not&nbsp;an), the <em>mâ</em> and <span class = "greek" title =
"mê">μή</span> <i>prohibitivum</i>, the <em>tara</em> and <span class =
"greek" title = "tero">τερο</span> as the suffix of the comparative, and
some others. A&nbsp;most decided divergence of opinion manifested itself
as touching the real relation of Greek and Latin. While some regarded
these languages not only as sisters, but as twins, others were not
inclined to concede to them any closer relationship than that which
unites all the members of the Aryan family. While this conflict of
opinions lasts (and they are not mere assertions, but opinions supported
by arguments), it is clear that it would be
<span class = "pagenum">214</span>
<a name = "page214" id = "page214"> </a>
premature to establish any historical conclusions, such, for instance,
as that the Slaves remained longer united with the Indians and Persians
than the Greeks, Romans, Germans, and Celts; or, if we follow Professor
Sonne, that the Greeks remained longer united with the Indians than the
other Aryan nations. I&nbsp;must confess that I doubt whether the whole
problem admits of a scientific solution. If in a large family of
languages we discover closer coincidences between some languages than
between others, this is no more than we should expect, according to the
working of what I call the Dialectic Process. All these languages sprang
up and grew and diverged, before they were finally separated; some
retained one form, others another, so that even the apparently most
distant members of the same family might, on certain points, preserve
relics in common which were lost in all the other dialects, and <i>vice
versâ</i>. No two languages, not even Lithuanian and Old Slavonic, are
so closely united as Sanskrit and Zend, which share together even
technical terms, connected with a complicated sacrificial ceremonial.
Yet there are words occurring in Zend, and absent in Sanskrit, which
crop up again sometimes in Greek, sometimes in Latin, sometimes in
German.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_4" id = "tagIV_4" href =
"#noteIV_4">4,</a><a class = "tag" href = "#chapIV_noteC">C</a> As soon
as we attempt to draw from such coincidences and divergences historical
conclusions as to the earlier or later separation of the nations who
developed these languages, we fall into contradictions like those which
I pointed out just now between Bopp, Grimm, Schleicher, Ebel, Grassmann,
Sonne, and others. Much depends, in all scientific researches, on seeing
that the question is properly put. To me the question,
<span class = "pagenum">215</span>
<a name = "page215" id = "page215"> </a>
whether the closer relations between certain independent dialects
furnish evidence as to the successive times of their separation, seems,
by its very nature, fruitless. Nor have the answers been at all
satisfactory. After a number of coincidences between the various members
of the Aryan family have been carefully collected, we know no more in
the end than what we knew at first, viz., that all the Aryan dialects
are closely connected with each other. We <span class =
"locked">know&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. That Slavonic is most closely united with German (Grimm,
Schleicher);</p>

<p>2. That German is most closely united with Celtic (Ebel,
Lottner);</p>

<p>3. That Celtic is most closely united with Latin (Newman,
Schleicher);</p>

<p>4. That Latin is most closely united with Greek (Mommsen,
Curtius);</p>

<p>5. That Greek is most closely united with Sanskrit (Grassmann, Sonne,
Kern);</p>

<p>6. That Sanskrit is most closely united with Zend (Burnouf).</p>

<p>Let a mathematician draw out the result, and it will be seen that we
know in the end no more than we knew at the beginning. Far be it for me
to use a mere trick in arguing, and to say that none of these
conclusions can be right, because each is contradicted by others. Quite
the contrary. I&nbsp;admit that there is some truth in every one of
these conclusions, and I maintain, for that very reason, that the only
way to reconcile them all is to admit that the single dialects of the
Aryan family did not break off in regular succession, but that, after a
long-continued community, they separated slowly, and, in some cases,
contemporaneously,
<span class = "pagenum">216</span>
<a name = "page216" id = "page216"> </a>
from their family-circle, till they established at last, under varying
circumstances, their complete national independence. This seems to me
all that at present one may say with a good conscience, and what is in
keeping with the law of development in all dialects.</p>

<p>If now we turn away from the purely philological results of the
Science of Language, in order to glance at the advantages which other
sciences have derived from it, we shall find that they consist mostly in
the light that has been shed on obscure words and old customs. This
advantage is greater than, at first sight, it might seem to be. Every
word has its history, and the beginning of this history, which is
brought to light by etymology, leads us back far beyond its first
historical appearance. Every word, as we know, had originally a
predicative meaning, and that predicative meaning differs often very
considerably from the later traditional or technical meaning. This
predicative meaning, however, being the most original meaning of the
word, allows us an insight into the most primitive ideas of a
nation.</p>

<p>Let us take an instance from jurisprudence. <i>Pœna</i>, in classical
Latin, means simply punishment, particularly what is either paid or
suffered in order to atone for an injury. (<i>Si&nbsp;injuriam faxit
alteri, viginti quinque æris pœnœ sunto, fragm. xii. tab.</i>) The word
agrees so remarkably, both in form and meaning, with the Greek <span
class = "greek" title = "poinê">ποινή</span>, that Mommsen assigned to
it a place in what he calls Græco-Italic ideas.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_5" id = "tagIV_5" href = "#noteIV_5">5</a> We might suppose,
therefore, that the ancient Italians took <i>pœna</i>
<span class = "pagenum">217</span>
<a name = "page217" id = "page217"> </a>
originally in the sense of ransom, simply as a civil act, by which he
who had inflicted injury on another was, as far as he and the injured
person were concerned, restored <i>in integrum</i>. The etymology of the
word, however, leads us back into a far more distant past, and shows us
that when the word <i>pœna</i> was first framed, punishment was
conceived from a higher moral and religious point of view, as a
purification from sin; for <i>pœna</i>, as first shown by Professor Pott
(and what has he not been the first to show?) is closely connected with
the root pu, to purify. Thus we read in the “Atharva-veda,” xix. <span
class = "locked">33,&nbsp;3:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class = "verse sanskrit">
<p>“Tvám bhû́mim átyeshi ójasâ</p>
<p>Tvám védyâm sîdasi cấrur adhvaré</p>
<p>Tvấm pavítram ṛshayo bhárantas</p>
<p>Tvám puníhi duritấni asmát.”</p>
</div>

<p class = "quote">
“Thou, O&nbsp;God of Fire, goest mightily across the earth; thou sittest
brilliantly on the altar at the sacrifice. The prophets carry Thee as
the Purifier; purify us from all misdeeds.”</p>

<p>From this root <em>pu</em> we have, in Latin, <i>pūrus</i>, and
<i>pŭtus</i>, as in <i>argentum purum putum</i>, fine silver, or in
<i>purus putus est ipse</i>, Plaut. Ps. 4, 2, 31. From it we also have
the verb <i>purgare</i>, for <i>purigare</i>, to purge, used
particularly with reference to purification from crime by means of
religious observances. If this transition from the idea of purging to
that of punishing should seem strange, we have only to think of
<i>castigare</i>, meaning originally to purify, but afterwards in such
expressions as <i>verbis et verberibus castigare</i>, to chide and to
chasten.</p>

<p>I cannot convince myself that the Latin <i>crimen</i> has anything in
common with <span class = "greek" title = "krinein">κρίνειν</span>. The
Greek <span class = "greek" title = "krinein">κρίνειν</span> is no doubt
connected with Latin <i>cer-no</i>, from which <i>cribrum</i>, sieve. It
means to separate, to sift, so that
<span class = "pagenum">218</span>
<a name = "page218" id = "page218"> </a>
<span class = "greek" title = "krima">κρῖμα</span> may well signify a
judgment, but not a crime or misdeed. <i>Crīmen</i>, as every scholar
knows or ought to know, meant originally an accusation, not a crime,
and, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, has nothing whatever
in common with <i>discrīmen</i>, which means what separates two things,
a&nbsp;difference, a&nbsp;critical point. <i>In crimen venire</i> means
to get into bad repute, to be calumniated; <i>in discrimine esse</i>
means to be in a critical and dangerous position.</p>

<p>It is one of the fundamental laws of etymology that in tracing words
back to their roots, we have to show that their primary, not their
secondary meanings agree with the meaning of the root. Therefore, even
if <i>crīmen</i> had assumed in later times the meaning of judgment, yet
its derivation from the Greek <span class = "greek" title =
"krinein">κρίνειν</span> would have to be rejected, because it would
explain the secondary only, but not the primary meaning of
<i>crīmen</i>. Nothing is clearer than the historical development of the
meanings of <i>crīmen</i>, beginning with accusation, and ending with
guilt.</p>

<p>I believe I have proved that <i>crīmen</i> is really and truly the
same word as the German <i>Verleumdung</i>, calumny.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_6" id = "tagIV_6" href = "#noteIV_6">6</a>
<i>Verleumdung</i> comes from <i>Leumund</i>, the Old High-German
<i>hliumunt</i>, and this <i>hliumunt</i> is the exact representative of
the Vedic <em>śromata</em>, derived from the root <em>śru</em>, to hear,
<i>cluere</i>, and signifying good report, glory, the Greek <span class
= "greek" title = "kleos">κλέος</span>, the Old High-German
<i>hruom</i>. The German word <i>Leumund</i> can be used in a good and a
bad sense, as good or evil report, while the Latin <i>crī-men</i>, for
<i>croe-men</i> (like <i>liber</i> for <i>loeber</i>), is used only
<i>in malam partem</i>. It meant originally what is heard, report, <i>on
dit</i>, gossip, accusation; lastly, the object of an accusation,
a&nbsp;crime, but never judgment, in the technical sense of the
word.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">219</span>
<a name = "page219" id = "page219"> </a>
<p>The only important objection that could be raised against tracing
<i>crīmen</i> back to the root <em>śru</em>, is that this root has in
the Northwestern branch of the Aryan family assumed the form
<em>clu</em>, instead of <em>cru</em>, as in <span class = "greek" title
= "kleos">κλέος</span>, <i>cliens</i>, <i>gloria</i>, O.Sl.
<i>slovo</i>, A.S. <i>hlûd</i>, loud, <i>inclutus</i>. I myself
hesitated for a long time on account of this phonetic difficulty, nor do
I think it is quite removed by the fact that Bopp (“Comp. Gr.”
§&nbsp;20) identified the German <i>scrir-u-mês</i>, we cry (instead of
<i>scriw-u-mês</i>), with Sk. <em>śrâv-ayâ-mas</em>, we make hear; nor
by the <i>r</i> in <i>in-cre-p-are</i>, in <span class = "greek" title =
"krazô">κράζω</span>, as compared with <span class = "greek" title =
"klazô">κλάζω</span>, nor even by the <i>r</i> in <span class = "greek"
title = "a-kro-a-omai">ἀ-κρο-ά-ομαι</span>, which Curtius seems inclined
to derive from <em>śru</em>. The question is whether this phonetic
difficulty is such as to force us to surrender the common origin of
<em>śromata</em>, <i>hliumunt</i>, and <i>crīmen</i>; but even if this
should be the case, the derivation of <i>crīmen</i> from <i>cerno</i> or
<span class = "greek" title = "krinein">κρίνειν</span> would remain as
impossible as ever.</p>

<p>This will give you an idea in what manner the Science of Language can
open before our eyes a period in the history of law, customs, and
manners, which hitherto was either entirely closed, or reached only by
devious paths. Formerly, for instance, it was supposed that the Latin
word <i>lex</i>, law, was connected with the Greek <span class = "greek"
title = "logos">λόγος</span>. This is wrong, for <span class = "greek"
title = "logos">λόγος</span> never means law in the sense in which
<i>lex</i> does. <span class = "greek" title = "Logos">λόγος</span>,
from <span class = "greek" title = "legein">λέγειν</span>, to collect,
to gather, signifies, like <span class = "greek" title =
"katalogos">κατάλογος</span>, a&nbsp;gathering, a&nbsp;collection, an
ordering, be it of words or thoughts. The idea that there is a <span
class = "greek" title = "logos">λόγος</span>, an order or law, for
instance, in nature, is not classical, but purely modern. It is not
improbable that <i>lex</i> is connected with the English word
<i>law</i>, only not by way of the Norman <i>loi</i>. English <i>law</i>
is A.S. <i>lagu</i> (as&nbsp;<i>saw</i> corresponds both to the German
<i>Sage</i>
<span class = "pagenum">220</span>
<a name = "page220" id = "page220"> </a>
and <i>Säge</i>), and it meant originally what was laid down or settled,
with exactly the same conception as the German <i>Gesetz</i>. It has
been attempted to derive the Latin <i>lex</i>, too, from the same root,
though there is this difficulty, that the root of <i>liegen</i> and
<i>legen</i> does not elsewhere occur in Latin. The mere disappearance
of the aspiration would be no serious obstacle. If, however, the Latin
<i>lex</i> cannot be derived from that root, we must, with Corssen,
refer it to the same cluster of words to which <i>ligare</i>, to bind,
<i>obligatio</i>, binding, and the Oscan ablative <i>lig-ud</i> belong,
and assign to it the original meaning of <i>bond</i>. On no account can
it be derived from <i>legere</i>, to read, as if it meant a bill first
read before the people, and afterwards receiving legal sanction by their
approval.</p>

<p>From these considerations we gain at least this negative result,
that, before their separation, the Aryan languages had no settled word
for law; and even such negative results have their importance. The
Sanskrit word for law is <em>dharma</em>, derived from <em>dhar</em>, to
hold fast. The Greek word is <span class = "greek" title =
"nomos">νόμος</span>, derived from <span class = "greek" title =
"nemein">νέμειν</span>, to dispense, from which <i>Nemesis</i>, the
dispensing deity, and perhaps even <i>Numa</i>, the name of the fabulous
king and lawgiver of Rome.</p>

<p>Other words might easily be added which, by the disclosure of their
original meaning, give us interesting hints as to the development of
legal conceptions and customs, such as marriage, inheritance, ordeals,
and the like. But it is time to cast a glance at theology, which, more
even than jurisprudence, has experienced the influence of the Science of
Language. What was said with regard to mythology, applies with equal
force to theology. Here, too, words harden, and remain unchanged longer
even than in
<span class = "pagenum">221</span>
<a name = "page221" id = "page221"> </a>
other spheres of intellectual life; nay, their influence often becomes
greater the more they harden, and the more their original meaning is
forgotten. Here it is most important that an intelligent theologian
should be able to follow up the historical development of the <i>termini
technici</i> and <i>sacrosancti</i> of his science. Not only words like
<i>priest</i>, <i>bishop</i>, <i>sacrament</i>, or <i>testament</i>,
have to be correctly apprehended in that meaning which they had in the
first century, but expressions like <span class = "greek" title =
"logos, pneuma hagion, dikaiosunê">λόγος, πνεῦμα ἅγιον,
δικαιοσύνη</span> have to be traced historically to the beginnings of
Christianity, and beyond, if we wish to gain a conception of their full
purport.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the Philosophy of Religion, which must always
form the true foundation of theological science, owes it to the Science
of Language that the deepest germs of the consciousness of God among the
different nations of the world have for the first time been laid open.
We know now with perfect certainty that the names, that is, the most
original conceptions, of the Deity among the Aryan nations, are as
widely removed from coarse fetichism as from abstract idealism. The
Aryans, as far as the annals of their language allow us to see,
recognized the presence of the Divine in the bright and sunny aspects of
nature, and they, therefore, called the blue sky, the fertile earth, the
genial fire, the bright day, the golden dawn their <em>Devas</em>, that
is, their bright ones. The same word, <em>Deva</em> in Sanskrit,
<i>Deus</i> in Latin, remained unchanged in all their prayers, their
rites, their superstitions, their philosophies, and even to-day it rises
up to heaven from thousands of churches and cathedrals,&mdash;a word
which, before there were Brahmans or Germans, had been framed in the
dark workshop of the Aryan mind.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
<a name = "page222" id = "page222"> </a>
<p>That the natural sciences, too, should have felt the electric shock
of our new science is not surprising, considering that man is the crown
of nature, the apex to which all other forces of nature point and tend.
But that which makes man man, is language. <i>Homo animal rationale,
quia orationale</i>, as Hobbes said. Buffon called the plant a sleeping
animal; living philosophers speak of the animal as a dumb man. Both,
however, forget that the plant would cease to be a plant if it awoke,
and that the brute would cease to be a brute the moment it began to
speak. There is, no doubt, in language a transition from the material to
the spiritual: the raw material of language belongs to nature, but the
form of language, that which really makes language, belongs to the
spirit. Were it possible to trace human language <i>directly</i> back to
natural sounds, to interjections or imitations, the question whether the
Science of Language belongs to the sphere of the natural or the
historical sciences would at once be solved. But I doubt whether this
crude view of the origin of language counts one single supporter in
Germany. With one foot language stands, no doubt, in the realm of
nature, but with the other in the realm of the spirit. Some years ago,
when I thought it necessary to bring out as clearly as possible the much
neglected natural element in language, I&nbsp;tried to explain in what
sense the Science of Language had a right to be called the last and the
highest of the natural sciences. But I need hardly say that I did not
lose sight, therefore, of the intellectual and historical character of
language; and I may here express my conviction that the Science of
Language will yet enable us to withstand the extreme theories of the
evolutionists, and
<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
<a name = "page223" id = "page223"> </a>
to draw a hard and fast line between spirit and matter, between man and
brute.</p>

<p>This short survey must suffice to show you how omnipresent the
Science of Language has become in all spheres of human knowledge, and
how far its limits have been extended, so that it often seems impossible
for one man to embrace the whole of its vast domain. From this I wish,
in conclusion, to draw some necessary advice.</p>

<p>Whoever devotes himself to the study of so comprehensive a science
must try never to lose sight of two virtues: conscientiousness and
modesty. The older we grow, the more we feel the limits of human
knowledge. “Good care is taken,” as Goethe said, “that trees should not
grow into the sky.” Every one of us can make himself real master of a
small field of knowledge only, and what we gain in extent, we inevitably
lose in depth. It was impossible that Bopp should know Sanskrit like
Colebrooke, Zend like Burnouf, Greek like Hermann, Latin like Lachmann,
German like Grimm, Slavonic like Miklosich, Celtic like Zeuss. That
drawback lies in the nature of all comparative studies. But it follows
by no means that, as the French proverb says, <i>qui trop embrasse, mal
étreint</i>. Bopp’s “Comparative Grammar” will always mark an epoch in
linguistic studies, and no one has accused the old master of
superficiality. There are, in fact, two kinds of knowledge; the one
which we take in as real nourishment, which we convert <i>in succum et
sanguinem</i>, which is always present, which we can never lose; the
other which, if I may say so, we put into our pockets, in order to find
it there whenever it is wanted. For comparative studies the second kind
of knowledge is as
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
<a name = "page224" id = "page224"> </a>
important as the first, but in order to use it properly, the greatest
conscientiousness is required. Not only ought we, whenever we have to
use it, to go back to the original sources, to accept nothing on trust,
to quote nothing at second-hand, and to verify every single point before
we rely on it for comparative purposes, but, even after we have done
everything to guard against error, we ought to proceed with the greatest
caution and modesty. I&nbsp;consider, for instance, that an accurate
knowledge of Sanskrit is a <i>conditio sine quâ non</i> in the study of
Comparative Philology. According to my conviction, though I know it is
not shared by others, Sanskrit must forever remain the central point of
our studies. But it is clearly impossible for us, while engaged in a
scholarlike study of Sanskrit, to follow at the same time the gigantic
strides of Latin, Greek, German, Slavonic, and Celtic philology. Here we
must learn to be satisfied with what is possible, and apply for advice
whenever we want it, to those who are masters in these different
departments of philology. Much has of late been said of the antagonism
between comparative and classical philology. To me it seems that these
two depend so much on each other for help and advice that their
representatives ought to be united by the closest ties of fellowship. We
must work on side by side, and accept counsel as readily as we give it.
Without the help of Comparative Philology, for instance, Greek scholars
would never have arrived at a correct understanding of the
Digamma&mdash;nay, a&nbsp;freer intercourse with his colleague, Bopp,
would have preserved Bekker from several mistakes in his restoration of
the Digamma in Homer. Latin scholars would have felt far more
<span class = "pagenum">225</span>
<a name = "page225" id = "page225"> </a>
hesitation in introducing the old <i>d</i> of the ablative in Plautus,
if the analogy of Sanskrit had not so clearly proved its legitimacy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we, comparative philologists, should readily ask
and gladly accept the advice and help of our classical colleagues.
Without their guidance, we can never advance securely; their warnings
are to us of the greatest advantage, their approval our best reward. We
are often too bold, we do not see all the difficulties that stand in the
way of our speculations, we are too apt to forget that, in addition to
its general Aryan character, every language has its peculiar genius. Let
us all be on our guard against omniscience and infallibility. Only
through a frank, honest, and truly brotherly coöperation can we hope for
a true advancement of knowledge. We all want the same thing; we all are
<i>etymologists</i>&mdash;that is, lovers of truth. For this, before all
things, the spirit of truth, which is the living spirit of all science,
must dwell within us. Whoever cannot yield to the voice of truth,
whoever cannot say, “I&nbsp;was wrong,” knows little as yet of the true
spirit of science.</p>

<p>Allow me, in conclusion, to recall to your remembrance another
passage from Niebuhr. He belongs to the good old race of German
scholars. “Above all things,” he writes, “we must in all scientific
pursuits preserve our truthfulness so pure that we thoroughly eschew
every false appearance; that we represent not even the smallest thing as
certain of which we are not completely convinced; that if we have to
propose a conjecture, we spare no effort in representing the exact
degree of its probability. If we do not ourselves, when it is possible,
indicate our errors, even such as no one else is likely to discover;
<span class = "pagenum">226</span>
<a name = "page226" id = "page226"> </a>
if, in laying down our pen, we cannot say in the sight of God, ‘Upon
strict examination, I&nbsp;have knowingly written nothing that is not
true;’ and if, without deceiving either ourselves or others, we have not
presented even our most odious opponents in such a light only that we
could justify it upon our death-beds&mdash;if we cannot do this, study
and literature serve only to make us unrighteous and sinful.”</p>

<p>Few, I fear, could add, with Niebuhr: “In this I am convinced that I
do not require from others anything of which a higher spirit, if He
could read my soul, could convict me of having done the contrary.” But
all of us, young as well as old, should keep these words before our eyes
and in our hearts. Thus, and thus only, will our studies not miss their
highest goal: thus, and thus only, may we hope to become true
etymologists&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, true lovers, seekers, and, I&nbsp;trust,
finders of truth.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">That</span> Greek θ does not legitimately
represent a Sanskrit, Latin, Slavonic, and Celtic <i>d</i> is a fact
that ought never to have been overlooked by comparative philologists,
and nothing could be more useful than the strong protest entered by
Windischmann, Schleicher, Curtius, and others, against the favorite
identification of Sk. <em>deva</em>, <i>deus</i>, and <span class =
"greek" title = "theos">θεός</span>. Considering it as one of the first
duties, in all etymological researches, that we should pay implicit
obedience to phonetic laws, I&nbsp;have never, so far as I remember,
quoted <span class = "greek" title = "theos">θεός</span> as identical
with <i>deus</i>, together with the other derivatives of the root
<em>div</em>, such as <em>Dyaus</em>, <span class = "greek" title =
"Zeus">Ζεύς</span>, <i>Jupiter</i>, <em>deva</em>, Lith. <i>deva-s</i>,
Irish <i>día</i>.</p>

<p>But with all due respect for phonetic laws, I have never in my own
heart doubted that <span class = "greek" title = "theos">θεός</span>
belonged to the same cluster of words which the early Aryans employed to
express the brightness of the sky and of the day, and which helped them
to utter their first conception of a god of the bright sky
(<em>Dyaus</em>), of bright beings in heaven, as opposed to the powers
of night and darkness and winter (<em>deva</em>), and, lastly, of deity
in the abstract.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_7" id = "tagIV_7" href =

not undervalue the powerful arguments advanced against the identity of
<i>deus</i> and <span class = "greek" title = "theos">θεός</span>,
I&nbsp;thought that other arguments also possessed their value, and
could not be ignored with impunity. If, with our eyes shut, we submit to
the dictates of phonetic laws, we are forced to believe that while the
Greeks shared with the Hindus, the Italians, and Germans the name for
the bright god of the sky Zeus, <em>Dyaus</em>, <i>Jovis</i>,
<i>Zio</i>, and while they again shared with them such derivatives as
<span class = "greek" title = "dios">δῖος</span>, heavenly, Sk.
<em>divyas</em>, they threw away the intermediate old Aryan word for
god, <em>deva</em>, <i>deus</i>, and formed
<span class = "pagenum">228</span>
<a name = "page228" id = "page228"> </a>
a new one from a different root, but agreeing with the word which they
had rejected in all letters but one. I&nbsp;suppose that even the
strongest supporters of the atheistic theory would have accepted <span
class = "greek" title = "deos">δεός</span>, if it existed in Greek, as a
correlative of <em>deva</em> and <i>deus</i>; and I ask, would it not be
an almost incredible coincidence, if the Greeks, after giving up the
common Aryan word, which would have been <span class = "greek" title =
"doiwos">δοιϝός</span> or <span class = "greek" title =
"deiwos">δειϝός</span> or <span class = "greek" title =
"dewos">δεϝός</span>, had coined a new word for god from a different
root, yet coming so near to <span class = "greek" title =
"dewos">δεϝός</span> as <span class = "greek" title =
"thewos">θεϝός</span>? These internal difficulties seem to me nearly as
great as the external: at all events it would not be right to attempt to
extenuate either.</p>

<p>Now I think that, though much has been said against <span class =
"greek" title = "theos">θεός</span> for <span class = "greek" title =
"dewos">δεϝός</span>, something may also be said in support of <span
class = "greek" title = "dewos">δεϝός</span> assuming the form of <span
class = "greek" title = "theos">θεός</span>. Curtius is quite right in
repelling all arguments derived from Sk. <em>duhitar</em> = <span class
= "greek" title = "thugatêr">θυγάτηρ</span>, or Sk. <em>dvâr</em> =
<span class = "greek" title = "thur-a">θύρ-α</span>; but I think he does
not do full justice to the argument derived from <span class = "greek"
title = "phialê">φιάλη</span> and <span class = "greek" title =
"phiaros">φιαρός</span>. The Greek <span class = "greek" title =
"phialê">φιάλη</span> has been explained as originally <span class =
"greek" title = "piwalê">πιϝάλη</span>, the lost digamma causing the
aspiration of the initial&nbsp;π. Curtius says: “This etymology of <span
class = "greek" title = "phialê">φιάλη</span> is wrecked on the fact
that in Homer the word does not mean a vessel for drinking, but a kind
of kettle.” That is true, but the fact remains that in later Greek <span
class = "greek" title = "phialê">φιάλη</span> means a drinking cup. Thus
Pindar (“Isthm.,” v.&nbsp;58) <span class =
"locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class = "verse">
<p><span class = "greek" title = "Andôke d’ autôi phertatos">Ἄνδωκε δ’
αὐτῷ φέρτατος</span></p>
<p><span class = "greek" title = "oinodokon phialan chrusôi pephrikuian Telamôn,">οἰνοδόκον φιάλαν χρυσῷ πεφρικυῖαν Τελαμών,</span></p>
</div>

<p>which refers clearly to a golden goblet, and not a kettle. Besides,
we have an exactly analogous case in the Sk. <em>pâtram</em>. This, too,
is clearly derived from <em>pâ</em>, to drink, but it is used far more
frequently in the sense of vessel in general, and its etymological
meaning vanishes altogether when it comes to mean a vessel for
something, a&nbsp;fit person. I&nbsp;see no etymology for <span class =
"greek" title = "phialê">φιάλη</span>, except <span class = "greek"
title = "piwalê">πιϝάλη</span>, a&nbsp;drinking vessel.</p>

<p>Secondly, as to <span class = "greek" title =
"phiaros">φιαρός</span>, which is supposed to be the same as <span class
= "greek" title = "piaros">πιαρός</span>, and to represent the Sanskrit
<em>pîvaras</em>, fat, Curtius says that it occurs in Alexandrian poets
only, that it there means bright, resplendent, and is used as an
adjective of the dawn, while <span class = "greek" title =
"piaros">πιαρός</span> means fat, and fat only. Against this I venture
to remark, first, that there are passages where <span class = "greek"
title = "phiaros">φιαρός</span> means sleek, as in Theocr. ii. 21, <span
class = "greek" title = "phiarôtera omphakos ômas">φιαρωτέρα ὄμφακος

while <span class = "greek" title = "piar">πῖαρ</span> is used for

surprising, if we remember the change of meaning in <span class =

in the Veda of such words as <em class = "sanskrit">ghṛta pratîka</em>,
to the dawn. Lastly, as in <span class = "greek" title =

title = "phiaros">φιαρός</span>, except <span class = "greek" title =
"piwaros">πιϝαρός</span>.</p>

<p>I think it is but fair therefore to admit that <span class = "greek"
title = "theos">θεός</span> for <span class = "greek" title =
"dewos">δεϝός</span> would find some support by the analogy of <span
class = "greek" title = "phialê">φιάλη</span> for <span class = "greek"
title = "piwalê">πιϝάλη</span>, and of <span class = "greek" title =
"phiaros">φιαρός</span> for <span class = "greek" title =
"piwaros">πιϝαρός</span>. There still remain difficulties enough to make
us cautious in asserting the identity of <span class = "greek" title =
"theos">θεός</span> and <i>deus</i>; but in forming our own opinion
these difficulties should be weighed impartially against the internal
difficulties involved in placing <span class = "greek" title =
"theos">θεός</span> as a totally independent word, by the side of
<em>deva</em> and <i>deus</i>. And, as in <span class = "greek" title =
"phialê">φιάλη</span> and <span class = "greek" title =
"phiaros">φιαρός</span>, may we not say of <span class = "greek" title =
"theos">θεός</span> also that there is no etymology for it, if we
separate it from <span class = "greek" title = "Zeus">Ζεύς</span> and
<span class = "greek" title = "dios">δῖος</span>, from <em>Dyaus</em>
and <em>divyas</em>? Curtius himself rejects Plato’s and Schleicher’s
derivation of <span class = "greek" title = "theos">θεός</span> from
<span class = "greek" title = "theô">θέω</span>, to run: likewise
C.&nbsp;Hoffmann’s from <em>dhava</em>, man; likewise Bühler’s from a
root <em>dhi</em>, to think or to shine; likewise that of Herodotus and
A.&nbsp;Göbel from <span class = "greek" title = "thes">θες</span>,
a&nbsp;secondary form of <span class = "greek" title = "the">θε</span>,
to settle. Ascoli’s analysis is highly sagacious, but it is too
artificial. Ascoli<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_8" id = "tagIV_8" href
= "#noteIV_8">8</a> identifies <span class = "greek" title =
"theos">θεός</span>, not with <em>deva</em>, but with <i>divyá-s</i>.
<em>Divyás</em> becoming <span class = "greek" title =
"diweos">διϝεός</span> (like <em>satya</em>, <span class = "greek" title
= "eteos">ἐτεός</span>), the accent on the last syllable would produce
the change to <span class = "greek" title = "dweo-s">δϝεό-ς</span>, ϝ
would cause aspiration in the preceding consonant and then disappear,
leaving <span class = "greek" title = "theos">θεός</span> =
<em>divyás</em>. All these changes are just possible phonetically, but,
as Curtius observes, the point for which the theists contend is not
gained, for we should still have to admit that the Greeks lost the
common word for god, <em>deva</em> and <i>deus</i>, and that they alone
replaced it by a derivative <em>divya</em>, meaning heavenly, not
bright.</p>

<p>Curtius himself seems in favor of deriving <span class = "greek"
title = "theos">θεός</span> from <span class = "greek" title =
"thes">θες</span>, to implore, which we have in <span class = "greek"
title = "thes-samenoi, thessanto, poluthestos">θεσ-σάμενοι, θέσσαντο,
πολύθεστος</span>, etc. <span class = "greek" title =
"Theos">Θεός</span>, taken as a passive derivative, might, he thinks,
have the meaning of <span class = "greek" title = "arêtos">ἀρητός</span>
in <span class = "greek" title = "poluarêtos">πολυάρητος</span>, and
mean the implored being. I&nbsp;cannot think that this is a satisfactory
derivation. It might be defended phonetically and etymologically, though
I cannot think of any analogous passive derivatives of a root ending in
<i>s</i>. Where it fails to carry conviction is in leaving unexplained
the loss of the common Aryan word for deity, and in putting in its place
a name that savors of very modern thought.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">230</span>
<a name = "page230" id = "page230"> </a>
<p>I think the strongest argument against the supposed aspirating power
of medial <i>v</i>, and its subsequent disappearance, lies in the fact
that there are so many words having medial <i>v</i>, which show no trace
of this phonetic process (Curtius, p.&nbsp;507). On the other hand, it
should be borne in mind, that the Greeks might have felt a natural
objection to the forms which would have rendered <em>deva</em> with real
exactness, I&nbsp;mean <span class = "greek" title =
"doios">δοιός</span> or <span class = "greek" title =
"deos">δέος</span>, the former conveying the meaning of double, the
latter of fear. A&nbsp;mere wish to keep the name for god distinct from
these words might have produced the phonetic anomaly of which we
complain; and, after all, though I do not like to use that excuse, there
are exceptions to phonetic laws. No one can explain how <span class =
"greek" title = "ogdoos">ὄγδοος</span> was derived from <span class =
"greek" title = "oktô">ὀκτώ</span> or <span class = "greek" title =
"hebdomos">ἕβδομος</span> from <span class = "greek" title =
"hepta">ἑπτά</span>, yet the internal evidence is too strong to be
shaken by phonetic objections. In the case of <span class = "greek"
title = "theos">θεός</span> and <i>deus</i> the internal evidence seems
to me nearly as strong as in <span class = "greek" title =
"ogdoos">ὄγδοος</span> and <span class = "greek" title =
"hebdomos">ἕβδομος</span>, and though unwilling to give a final verdict,
I&nbsp;think the question of the loss in Greek of the Aryan word for god
and its replacement by another word nearly identical in form, but
totally distinct in origin, should be left for the present an open
question in Comparative Philology.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> vocative of <em>Dyaus</em>,
having the circumflex, is one of those linguistic gems which one finds
now and then in the Rig-Veda, and which by right ought to have a place
of honor in a Museum of Antiquities. It is a unique form. It occurs but
once in the Rig-Veda, never again, as far as we know at present, in the
whole of Vedic literature, and yet it is exactly that form which a
student of language would expect who is familiar with the working of the
laws of accent in Sanskrit and in Greek. Without a thorough knowledge of
these laws, the circumflexed vocative in Sanskrit, <ins class =
"notation" title = "printed with Greek-style circumflex (looks like a tilde)"><em>Dyaûs</em></ins>, corresponding to Greek <span class =
"greek" title = "Zeu">Ζεῦ</span>, would seem a mere anomaly, possibly an
accidental coincidence, whereas in reality it affords the most striking
proof of the organic working of the laws of accent, and at the same time
an unanswerable testimony in favor of the genuineness of the ancient
text of the Rig-Veda.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">231</span>
<a name = "page231" id = "page231"> </a>
<p>The laws of accent bearing on this circumflexed vocative are so
simple that I thought they would have been understood by everybody. As
this does not seem to have been the case, I&nbsp;add a few explanatory
remarks.</p>

<p>It was Benfey who, as on so many other points, so on the accent of
vocatives, was the first to point out (in&nbsp;1845) that it was a
fundamental law of the Aryan language to place the acute on the first
syllable of all vocatives, both in the singular, and in the dual and
plural.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_9" id = "tagIV_9" href =
"#noteIV_9">9</a> In Sanskrit this law admits of no exception; in Greek
and Latin the rhythmic accent has prevailed to that extent that we only
find a few traces left of the original Aryan accentuation. It is well
known that in vocatives of nouns ending in <i>ius</i>, the ancient
Romans preserved the accent on the first syllable, that they said
<i>Vírgili</i>, <i>Váleri</i>, from <i>Virgílius</i> and
<i>Valérius</i>. This statement of Nigidius Figulus, preserved by
Gellius, though with the remark that in his time no one would say so, is
the only evidence of the former existence of the Aryan law of
accentuation in Latin. In Greek the evidence is more considerable, but
the vocatives with the accent on the first syllable are, by the supreme
law of the rhythmic accent in Greek, reduced to vocatives, drawing back
their accent as far as they can, consistently with the law which
restricts the accent to the last three syllables. Thus while in Sanskrit
a word like <span class = "greek" title = "Agamemnôn">Ἀγαμέμνων</span>
would in the vocative retract the accent on the first syllable <span
class = "greek" title = "Agamemnon">Ἄγαμεμνον</span>, the Greek could do
no more than say <span class = "greek" title =
"Agamemnon">Ἀγάμεμνον</span> with the accent on the antepenultimate. In
the same manner the vocative of <span class = "greek" title =
"Aristotelês">Ἀριστοτέλης</span>, can only be <span class = "greek"
title = "Aristoteles">Ἀριστότελες</span>, whereas in Sanskrit it would
have been <span class = "greek" title =
"Aristoteles">Ἄριστοτελες</span>.</p>

<p>Here, however, the question arises, whether in words like <span class
= "greek" title = "Agamemnôn">Ἀγαμέμνων</span><a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_10" id = "tagIV_10" href = "#noteIV_10">10</a> and <span class =
"greek" title = "Aristotelês">Ἀριστοτέλης</span><a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_11" id = "tagIV_11" href = "#noteIV_11">11</a> the accent was not
originally on the antepenultimate, but drawn on the penultimate by the
rhythmic law. This is certainly the case in <span class = "greek" title
= "hêdion">ἥδιον</span>, as the vocative of <span class = "greek" title
= "hêdiôn">ἡδίων</span>, for we know that both in Sanskrit and Greek,
comparatives in <span class = "greek" title = "iôn">ιων</span> retract
their accent as far as possible, and have it always on the first
syllable in Sanskrit, always on the penultimate
<span class = "pagenum">232</span>
<a name = "page232" id = "page232"> </a>
in Greek, if the last syllable is long. But, <i>cessante causâ cessat
effectus</i>, and therefore the accent goes back on the antepenultimate,
not only in the vocative, but likewise in the nom. neuter <span class =
"greek" title = "hêdion">ἥδιον</span>.</p>

<p>It is possible that the same process may explain the vocative <span
class = "greek" title = "despota">δέσποτα</span> from <span class =
"greek" title = "despotês">δεσπότης</span>, if we compare Sanskrit
compounds with <em>pati</em>, such as <em>dâsápati</em>,
<em>gấspati</em>, <em>dámpati</em>, which leave the accent on the first
member of the compound. In <span class = "greek" title =
"Dêmêtêr">Δημήτηρ</span> also all becomes regular, if we admit the
original accentuation to have been <span class = "greek" title =
"Dêmêtêr">Δήμητηρ</span>, changed in <span class = "greek" title =
"Dêmêtêr">Δημήτηρ</span>, but preserved in the genitive <span class =
"greek" title = "Dêmêtros">Δήμητρος</span>, and the vocative <span class
= "greek" title = "Dêmêter">Δήμητερ</span>.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_12" id = "tagIV_12" href = "#noteIV_12">12</a></p>

<p>But there are other words in which this cannot be the case, for
instance, <span class = "greek" title = "adelphe, ponêre, mochthere">ἄδελφε, πόνηρε, μόχθερε</span> from <span class = "greek"
title = "adelphos, ponêros, mochthêros">ἀδελφός, πονηρός,
μοχθηρός</span>. Here the accent is the old Aryan vocatival accent.
Again, in <span class = "greek" title = "patêr, patera">πατήρ,
πατέρα</span>, Sk. <em>pitấ</em>, <em>pitáram</em>, in <span class =
"greek" title = "mêtêr, mêtera">μήτηρ, μητέρα</span>, Sk.
<em>mâtấ</em>, <em>mâtáram</em>, in <span class = "greek" title =
"thugatêr, thugatera">θυγάτηρ, θυγατέρα</span>, Sk. <em>duhitấ</em>,
<em>duhitáram</em>, the radical accent was throughout on the suffix
<em>tár</em>, nor would the rules of the rhythmic accent in Greek
prevent it from being on the antepenultimate in the accusative. The fact
therefore that it is retracted on the penultimate and antepenultimate in
the vocative, shows clearly that we have here, too, the last working of
the original Aryan accentuation. The irregular accent in the nom. sing.
of <span class = "greek" title = "mêtêr">μήτηρ</span>, instead of <span
class = "greek" title = "mêtêr">μητήρ</span>, is probably due to the
frequent use of the vocative (an&nbsp;explanation which I had adopted
before I had seen Benfey’s essay), and the same cause may explain the
apparently irregular accentuation in <span class = "greek" title =
"thugatra">θύγατρα</span>, by the side of <span class = "greek" title =
"thugatera">θυγατέρα</span>, in <span class = "greek" title =
"thugatres">θύγατρες</span>, and <span class = "greek" title =
"thugatras">θύγατρας</span>. Similar vocatives with retracted accent are
<span class = "greek" title = "daer">δᾶερ</span>, nom. <span class =
"greek" title = "daêr">δαήρ</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"einater">εἴνατερ</span>, nom. <span class = "greek" title =
"einatêr">εἰνάτηρ</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"gunai">γύναι</span>, nom. <span class = "greek" title =
"gunê">γυνή</span>, <span class = "greek" title = "sôter">σῶτερ</span>,
nom. <span class = "greek" title = "sôtêr">σωτήρ</span>, <span class =
"greek" title = "aner">ἄνερ</span>, nom. <span class = "greek" title =
"anêr">ἀνήρ</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"Apollon">Ἄπολλον</span>, nom. <span class = "greek" title =
"Apollôn">Ἀπόλλων</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"Poseidon">Πόσειδον</span>, nom. <span class = "greek" title =
"Poseidôn">Ποσειδῶν</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"Hêrakles">Ἥρακλες</span>, nom. <span class = "greek" title =
"Hêraklês">Ἡρακλῆς</span>.</p>

<p>We have thus established the fact that one feature of the primitive
Aryan accentuation, which consisted in the very natural process of
placing the high accent on the first syllable of vocatives, was strictly
preserved in Sanskrit, while in Greek and Latin it only left some
scattered traces of its former existence. Without the light derived from
Sanskrit, the changes in the accent of vocatives in Greek and Latin
would be inexplicable, they would be, what they are in Greek grammar,
mere anomalies; while, if placed by the side of Sanskrit, they are
readily recognized
<span class = "pagenum">233</span>
<a name = "page233" id = "page233"> </a>
as what they really are, remnants of a former age, preserved by frequent
usage or by an agent whom we do not like to recognize, though we cannot
altogether ignore him,&mdash;viz. chance.</p>

<p>Taking our position on the fact that change of accent in the vocative
in Greek is due to the continued influence of an older system of Aryan
accentuation, we now see how the change of nom. <span class = "greek"
title = "Zeus">Ζεύς</span> into voc. <span class = "greek" title =
"Zeu">Ζεῦ</span>, and of nom. <em>Dyaús</em>, into voc. <em>Dyaû́s</em>,
rests on the same principle. In Sanskrit the change, though at first
sight irregular, admits of explanation. What we call the circumflex in
Sanskrit, is the combination of a rising and falling of the voice, or,
as we should say in Greek, of an acute and grave accent. As
<em>Dyaús</em> was originally <em>Diaús</em>, and is frequently used as
two syllables in the Veda, the vocative would have been <em>Díaùs</em>,
and this contracted would become <em>Dyaus</em>. Thus we have
<em>paribhvế</em> from <em>paribhûs</em>. In Greek the facts are the
same, but the explanation is more difficult. The general rule in Greek
is that vocatives in <span class = "greek" title = "ou, oi">ου,
οι</span>, and <span class = "greek" title = "eu">ευ</span>, from
oxytone or perispome nominatives, are perispome; as <span class =
"greek" title = "plakou">πλακοῦ</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"bou">βοῦ</span>, <span class = "greek" title = "Lêtoi">Λητοῖ</span>,
<span class = "greek" title = "Pêleu">Πηλεῦ</span>, <span class =
"greek" title = "basileu">βασιλεῦ</span>, from <span class = "greek"
title = "plakous, ountos">πλακοῦς, οῦντος</span>, placenta, <span class
= "greek" title = "bous">βοῦς</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"Lêtô">Λητώ</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"Pêleus">Πηλεύς</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"basileus">βασιλεύς</span>. The rationale of that rule has never been
explained, as far as Greek is concerned. Under this rule the vocative of
<span class = "greek" title = "Zeus">Ζεύς</span> becomes <span class =
"greek" title = "Zeu">Ζεῦ</span>; but no Greek grammarian has attempted
to explain the process by which <span class = "greek" title =
"Zeus">Ζεύς</span> becomes <span class = "greek" title =
"Zeu">Ζεῦ</span>, and nothing remains for the present but to admit that
we have in it an ancient Aryan relic preserved in Greek long after the
causes which had produced it had ceased to act. It would fall into the
same category as <span class = "greek" title = "eimi">εἶμι</span> and
<span class = "greek" title = "imen">ἴμεν</span>. Here, too, the
efficient cause of the length and shortness of the radical vowel
<i>i</i>, viz., the change of accent, Sk. <em>émi</em>, but
<em>imás</em>, has disappeared in Greek, while its effect has been
preserved. But whatever explanation may hereafter be adopted, the simple
fact which I had pointed out remains, the motive power which changed the
nom. <em>dyaús</em> into the vocative <em>dyaû́s</em>, is the same which
changed <span class = "greek" title = "Zeus">Ζεύς</span> into <span
class = "greek" title = "Zeu">Ζεῦ</span>. Those who do not understand,
or do not admit this, are bound to produce, from the resources of Greek
itself, another motive power to account for the change of <span class =
"greek" title = "Zeus">Ζεύς</span> into <span class = "greek" title =
"Zeu">Ζεῦ</span>; but they must not imagine that a mere reference to a
Greek elementary grammar suffices for explaining that process.</p>

<p>The passage in the Rig-Veda (VI. 51, 5) to which I referred is
unique, and I therefore give it here, though it has in the meantime
<span class = "pagenum">234</span>
<a name = "page234" id = "page234"> </a>
been most ably discussed by Benfey in his “Essay on the Vocative”
(1872).</p>

<p>This passage is clearly one of great antiquity, for it still
recognizes <em>Dyaús</em>, the father, as the supreme god, Earth, the
mother, by his side, and Agni, fire, as the brother, not of Heaven and
Earth, but of man, because living with men on the hearth of their
houses. <em>Vasu</em>, as a general name of the bright gods, like
<em>deva</em> in other hymns, corresponds, I&nbsp;believe, to the Greek
adjective <span class = "greek" title = "eus">ἐΰς</span>. The genitive
plural <span class = "greek" title = "eaôn">ἐάων</span> is likewise
derived from <span class = "greek" title = "eus">ἐΰς</span> or
<em>vásus</em>, by Benfey (l.c. p.&nbsp;57), and <em>dâtấ vásûnâm</em>
(Rv.&nbsp;VIII. 51,&nbsp;5) comes certainly very near to <span class =
"greek" title = "dotêr eaôn">δοτὴρ ἐάων</span>. The only difficulty
would be the ā instead of the η, as in <span class = "greek" title =
"eêos">ἐῆος</span>, the gen. sing. of <span class = "greek" title =
"eus">ἐΰς</span> in Homer, a&nbsp;difficulty which might be removed by
tracing the gen. plur. <span class = "greek" title = "eaôn">ἐάων</span>
back to a fem. <span class = "greek" title = "ea">ἐά</span>,
corresponding to a Sk. <em>vasavî</em> or <em>vasavyâ</em><ins class =
"correction" title = "text has , for .">. </ins>As to <span class =
"greek" title = "meldete">μέλδετε</span>, it is phonetically the nearest
approach to <ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘m{ri}{l}ata’"><em class = "sanskrit">mṛlata</em></ins>, <i>i.e.</i>,
*<em>mardata</em>, though in Greek it means “make mild” rather than “be
mild.” Mild and <i>mollis</i> come from the same root.</p>

<p>What gives to this passage its special value is, that in all other
passages when <em>dyaus</em> occurs as a vocative and as bisyllabic, it
appears simply with the <i>udâtta</i>, thus showing at how early a time
even the Hindus forgot the meaning of the circumflex on <i>dyaû́s</i>,
and its legitimate appearance in that place. Thus in Rv. VIII. 100, 12,
we <span class = "locked">read,&mdash;</span></p>

"ana">ἀνά</span>; Goth, <i>ana</i>, upon.</p>

<p>Zend <em>erezataêna</em>, adj., made of silver; Lat.
<i>argentinus</i>. In Sk. we have <em>rajatam</em>, silver, but no
corresponding adjective.</p>

<p>Zend <em>içi</em>, ice; O.N. <i>îss</i>; A.S. <i>îs</i>; O.H.S.
<i>îs</i>.</p>

<p>Grimm compares the Irish <i>eirr</i>, snow, and he remarks that the
other Aryan languages have each framed their own words for ice, Lith.
<i>ledas</i>, O.S. <i>led</i>, and distantly connected with these,
through the Russian <i>cholodnyi</i>, the Latin <i>glacies</i>, for
<i>gelacies</i>, Greek <span class = "greek" title = "kruos, krumos, krustallos">κρύος, κρυμός, κρύσταλλος</span>.</p>

<p>The root from which these Greek words for ice are derived has left
several derivatives in other languages, such as Lat. <i>cru-s-ta</i>,
and O.N. <i>hrî-m</i>, rime, hoar-frost, and in Zend <em>khrûta</em>,
used as an adjective of <em>zim</em>, winter, originally the hard
winter. In Zend <em>khrûma</em>, and <em>khrûra</em>, Sk.
<em>krûra</em>, as in Greek <span class = "greek" title =
"kruoeis">κρυόεις</span>, the meaning has changed to <i>crudus</i>,
<i>crudelis</i>. In the English <i>raw</i>, O.H.G. <i>hrâo</i>, a
similar change of meaning may be observed.</p>

<p>Another name connected with ice and winter is the Zend <em>zyâo</em>,
frost, from the root <em>hi</em>, which has given us <span class =
"greek" title = "chi-ôn">χι-ών</span>, Sk.
<span class = "pagenum">236</span>
<a name = "page236" id = "page236"> </a>
<em>hi-ma</em>, Lat. <i>hiem-s</i>, O.S. <i>zima</i>, but which in the
simplest form has been preserved in Zend only and in the O.N. <i>gȩ</i>.
Fick quotes <i>gȩ</i> with the doubtful meanings of cold and snow,
Curtius with that of storm, identifying it with Norw. <i>gjö</i>, <i>nix
autumni recens</i>.</p>

<p>There is still another name for snow, absent in Sanskrit, but fully
represented in Zend and the other Aryan languages, viz., Zend
<i>çnizh</i>, to snow, Lat. <i>nix</i>, Goth. <i>snaív-s</i>, Lith.
<i>snig-ti</i>, to snow, Ir. <i>snechta</i>, snow, Gr. <span class =
