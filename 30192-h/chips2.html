<h6>DELIVERED IN THE NAVE OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY,<br>
ON THE EVENING OF DECEMBER 3, 1873.</h6>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> number of religions which have
attained stability and permanence in the history of the world is very
small. If we leave out of consideration those vague and varying forms of
faith and worship which
<span class = "pagenum">239</span>
<a name = "page239" id = "page239"> </a>
we find among uncivilized and unsettled races, among races ignorant of
reading and writing, who have neither a literature nor laws, nor even
hymns and prayers handed down by oral teaching from father to son, from
mother to daughter, we see that the number of the real historical
religions of mankind amounts to no more than eight. The Semitic races
have produced three&mdash;the Jewish, the Christian, the Mohammedan; the
Aryan, or Indo-European races an equal
<span class = "pagenum">240</span>
<a name = "page240" id = "page240"> </a>
number&mdash;the Brahman, the Buddhist, and the Parsi. Add to these the
two religious systems of China, that of Confucius and Lao-tse, and you
have before you what may be called the eight distinct languages or
utterances of the faith of mankind from the beginning of the world to
the present day; you have before you in broad outlines the religious map
of the whole world.</p>

<p>All these religions, however, have a history, a history more deeply
interesting than the history of language, or literature, or art, or
politics. Religions are not unchangeable; on the contrary, they are
always growing and changing; and if they cease to grow and cease to
change, they cease to live. Some of these religions stand by themselves,
totally independent of all the rest; others are closely united, or have
influenced each other during various stages of their growth and decay.
They must therefore be studied together, if we wish to understand their
real character, their growth, their decay, and their resuscitations.
Thus, Mohammedanism would be unintelligible without Christianity;
Christianity without Judaism: and there are similar bonds that hold
together the great religions of India and Persia&mdash;the faith of the
Brahman, the Buddhist, and the Parsi. After a careful study of the
origin and growth of these religions, and after a critical examination
of the sacred books on which all of them profess to be founded, it has
become possible to subject them all to a scientific classification, in
the same manner as languages, apparently unconnected and mutually
unintelligible, have been scientifically arranged and classified; and by
a comparison of those points which all or some of them share in common,
as well as by a determination of
<span class = "pagenum">241</span>
<a name = "page241" id = "page241"> </a>
those which are peculiar to each, a&nbsp;new science has been called
into life, a&nbsp;science which concerns us all, and in which all who
truly care for religion must sooner or later take their
part&mdash;<i>the Science of Religion</i>.</p>

<p>Among the various classifications<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_2" id
= "tagV_2" href = "#noteV_2">2</a> which have been applied to the
religions of the world, there is one that interests us more immediately
to-night, I&nbsp;mean the division into Non-Missionary and Missionary
religions. This is by no means, as might be supposed,
a&nbsp;classification based on an unimportant or merely accidental
characteristic; on the contrary, it rests on what is the very
heart-blood in every system of human faith. Among the six religions of
the Aryan and Semitic world, there are three that are opposed to all
missionary enterprise&mdash;Judaism, Brahmanism, and Zoroastrianism; and
three that have a missionary character from their very
beginning&mdash;Buddhism, Mohammedanism, and Christianity.</p>

<p>The Jews, particularly in ancient times, never thought of spreading
their religion. Their religion was to them a treasure, a&nbsp;privilege,
a&nbsp;blessing, something to distinguish them, as the chosen people of
God, from all the rest of the world. A&nbsp;Jew must be of the seed of
Abraham: and when in later times, owing chiefly to political
circumstances, the Jews had to admit strangers to some of the privileges
of their theocracy, they looked upon them, not as souls that had been
gained, saved, born again into a new brotherhood, but as strangers <span
class = "greek" dir = "rtl" title = "[Hebrew] gerim">גְּרֵיים</span>, as
Proselytes (<span class = "greek" title =
"prosêlutoi">προσήλυτοι</span>); which means men who have come to
<span class = "pagenum">242</span>
<a name = "page242" id = "page242"> </a>
them as aliens, not to be trusted, as their saying was, until the
twenty-fourth generation.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_3" id = "tagV_3"
href = "#noteV_3">3</a></p>

<p>A very similar feeling prevented the Brahmans from ever attempting to
proselytize those who did not by birth belong to the spiritual
aristocracy of their country. Their wish was rather to keep the light to
themselves, to repel intruders; they went so far as to punish those who
happened to be near enough to hear even the sound of their prayers, or
to witness their sacrifices.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_4" id =
"tagV_4" href = "#noteV_4">4</a></p>

<p>The Parsi, too, does not wish for converts to his religion; he is
proud of his faith, as of his blood; and though he believes in the final
victory of truth and light, though he says to every man, “Be bright as
the sun, pure as the moon,” he himself does very little to drive away
spiritual darkness from the face of the earth, by letting the light that
is within him shine before the world.</p>

<p>But now let us look at the other cluster of religions, at Buddhism,
Mohammedanism, and Christianity. However they may differ from each other
in some of their most essential doctrines, this they share in
common&mdash;they all have faith in themselves, they all have life and
vigor, they want to convince, they mean to conquer. From the very
earliest dawn of their existence these three religions were missionary;
their very founders, or their first apostles, recognized
<span class = "pagenum">243</span>
<a name = "page243" id = "page243"> </a>
the new duty of spreading the truth, of refuting error, of bringing the
whole world to acknowledge the paramount, if not the divine, authority
of their doctrines. This is what gives to them all a common expression,
and lifts them high above the level of the other religions of the
world.</p>

<p>Let us begin with Buddhism. We know, indeed, very little of its
origin and earliest growth, for the earliest beginnings of all religions
withdraw themselves by necessity from the eye of the historian. But we
have something like contemporary evidence of the Great Council, held at
<span class = "sanskrit">Pâṭaliputra</span>, 246 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>, in which the sacred canon of the Buddhist
scriptures was settled, and at the end of which missionaries were chosen
and sent forth to preach the new doctrine, not only in India, but far
beyond the frontiers of that vast country.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_5" id = "tagV_5" href = "#noteV_5">5</a> We possess inscriptions
containing the edicts of the king who was to Buddhism what Constantine
was to Christianity, who broke with the traditions of the old religion
of the Brahmans, and recognized the doctrines of Buddha as the state
religion of India. We possess the description of the Council of <span
class = "sanskrit">Pâṭaliputra</span>, which was to India what the
Council of Nicæa, 570 years later, was to Europe; and we can still read
there<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_6" id = "tagV_6" href =
"#noteV_6">6</a> the simple story, how the chief elder who had presided
over the Council, an old man, too weak to travel by land, and carried
from his hermitage to the Council in a boat&mdash;how that man, when the
Council was over, began to reflect on the future, and found that the
time had come to establish the religion of Buddha in foreign countries.
He therefore dispatched some of the most eminent priests to Cashmere,
Cabul, and farther west,
<span class = "pagenum">244</span>
<a name = "page244" id = "page244"> </a>
to the colonies founded by the Greeks in Bactria, to Alexandria on the
Caucasus, and other cities. He sent others northward to Nepal, and to
the inhabited portions of the Himalayan mountains. Another mission
proceeded to the Dekhan, to the people of Mysore, to the Mahrattas,
perhaps to Goa; nay, even Birma and Ceylon are mentioned as among the
earliest missionary stations of Buddhist priests. We still possess
accounts of their manner of preaching. When threatened by infuriated
crowds, one of those Buddhist missionaries said calmly, “If the whole
world, including the Deva heavens, were to come and terrify me, they
would not be able to create in me fear and terror.” And when he had
brought the people to listen, he dismissed them with the simple prayer,
“Do not hereafter give way to anger, as before; do not destroy the
crops, for all men love happiness. Show mercy to all living beings, and
let men dwell in peace.”</p>

<p>No doubt, the accounts of the successes achieved by those early
missionaries are exaggerated, and their fights with snakes and dragons
and evil spirits remind us sometimes of the legendary accounts of the
achievements of such men as St. Patrick in Ireland, or St. Boniface in
Germany. But the fact that missionaries were sent out to convert the
world seems beyond the reach of reasonable doubt;<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_7" id = "tagV_7" href = "#noteV_7">7</a> and this fact represents
to us at that time a new thought, new, not only in the history of India,
but in the history of the whole world. The recognition of a duty to
preach the truth to every man, woman, and child, was an
<span class = "pagenum">245</span>
<a name = "page245" id = "page245"> </a>
idea opposed to the deepest instincts of Brahmanism; and when, at the
end of the chapter on the first missions, we read the simple words of
the old chronicler, “who would demur, if the salvation of the world is
at stake?” we feel at once that we move in a new world, we see the dawn
of a new day, the opening of vaster horizons&mdash;we feel, for the
first time in the history of the world, the beating of the great heart
of humanity.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_8" id = "tagV_8" href =
"#noteV_8">8,</a><a class = "tag" href = "#chapV_noteA">A</a></p>

<p>The Koran breathes a different spirit; it does not invite, it rather
compels the world to come in. Yet there are passages, particularly in
the earlier portions, which show that Mohammed, too, had realized the
idea of humanity, and of a religion of humanity; nay, that at first he
wished to unite his own religion with that of the Jews and Christians,
comprehending all under the common name of Islâm. Islâm meant originally
humility or devotion; and all who humbled themselves before God, and
were filled with real reverence, were called Moslim. “The Islâm,” says
Mohammed, “is the true worship of God. When men dispute with you, say,
‘I&nbsp;am a Moslim.’ Ask those who have sacred books, and ask the
heathen; ‘Are you Moslim?<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ” for ’">’ </ins>If they are, they are on the right path; but if they turn
away, then you have no other task but to deliver the message, to preach
to them the Islâm.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_9" id = "tagV_9" href =
"#noteV_9">9</a></p>

<p>As to our own religion, its very soul is missionary, progressive,
world-embracing; it would cease to exist, if it ceased to be
missionary&mdash;if it disregarded
<span class = "pagenum">246</span>
<a name = "page246" id = "page246"> </a>
the parting words of its Founder: “Go ye therefore and teach all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things I have commanded;
and, lo, I&nbsp;am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.”</p>

<p>It is this missionary character, peculiar to these three religions,
Buddhism, Mohammedanism, and Christianity, which binds them together,
and lifts them to a higher sphere. Their differences, no doubt, are
great; on some points they are opposed to each other like day and night.
But they could not be what they are, they could not have achieved what
they have achieved, unless the spirit of truth and the spirit of love
had been alive in the hearts of their founders, their first messengers,
and missionaries.</p>

<p>The spirit of truth is the life-spring of all religion, and where it
exists it must manifest itself, it must plead, it must persuade, it must
convince and convert. Missionary work, however, in the usual sense of
the word, is only one manifestation of that spirit; for the same spirit
which fills the heart of the missionary with daring abroad, gives
courage also to the preacher at home, bearing witness to the truth that
is within him. The religions which can boast of missionaries who left
the old home of their childhood, and parted with parents and
friends&mdash;never to meet again in this life&mdash;who went into the
wilderness, willing to spend a life of toil among strangers, ready, if
need be, to lay down their life as witnesses to the truth, as martyrs
for the glory of God&mdash;the same religions are rich also in those
honest and intrepid inquirers who, at the bidding of the same spirit of
truth,
<span class = "pagenum">247</span>
<a name = "page247" id = "page247"> </a>
were ready to leave behind them the cherished creed of their childhood,
to separate from the friends they loved best, to stand alone among men
that shrug their shoulders, and ask, “What is truth?” and to bear in
silence a martyrdom more galling often than death itself. There are men
who say that, if they held the whole truth in their hand, they would not
open one finger. Such men know little of the working of the spirit of
truth, of the true missionary spirit. As long as there are doubt and
darkness and anxiety in the soul of an inquirer, reticence may be his
natural attitude. But when once doubt has yielded to certainty, darkness
to light, anxiety to joy, the rays of truth will burst forth; and to
close our hand or to shut our lips would be as impossible as for the
petals of a flower to shut themselves against the summons of the sun of
spring.</p>

<p>What is there in this short life that should seal our lips? What
should we wait for, if we are not to speak <i>here</i> and <i>now</i>?
There is missionary work at home as much as abroad; there are thousands
waiting to listen if <i>one</i> man will but speak the truth, and
nothing but the truth; there are thousands starving, because they cannot
find that food which is convenient for them.</p>

<p>And even if the spirit of truth might be chained down by fear or
prudence, the spirit of love would never yield. Once recognize the
common brotherhood of mankind, not as a name or a theory, but as a real
bond, as a bond more binding, more lasting than the bonds of family,
caste, and race, and the questions, Why should I upon my hand? why
should I open my heart? why should I speak to my brother? will never be
asked again. Is it not
<span class = "pagenum">248</span>
<a name = "page248" id = "page248"> </a>
far better to speak than to walk through life silent, unknown,
unknowing? Has any one of us ever spoken to his friend, and opened to
him his inmost soul, and been answered with harshness or repelled with
scorn? Has any one of us, be he priest or layman, ever listened to the
honest questionings of a truth-loving soul, without feeling his own soul
filled with love? aye, without feeling humbled by the very honesty of a
brother’s confession?</p>

<p>If we would but confess, friend to friend, if we would be but honest,
man to man, we should not want confessors or confessionals.</p>

<p>If our doubts and difficulties are self-made, if they can be removed
by wiser and better men, why not give to our brother the opportunity of
helping us? But if our difficulties are not self-made, if they are not
due either to ignorance or presumption, is it not even then better for
us to know that we are all carrying the same burden, the common burden
of humanity, if haply we may find, that for the heavy laden there is but
one who can give them rest?</p>

<p>There may be times when silence is gold, and speech silver: but there
are times also when silence is death, and speech is life&mdash;the very
life of Pentecost.</p>

<p>How can man be afraid of man? How can we be afraid of those whom we
love?</p>

<p>Are the young afraid of the old? But nothing delights the older man
more than to see that he is trusted by the young, and that they believe
he will tell them the truth.</p>

<p>Are the old afraid of the young? But nothing sustains the young more
than to know that they do not stand alone in their troubles, and that in
many trials of the soul the father is as helpless as the child.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">249</span>
<a name = "page249" id = "page249"> </a>
<p>Are the women afraid of men? But men are not wiser in the things
appertaining to God than women, and real love of God is theirs far more
than ours.</p>

<p>Are men afraid of women? But though women may hide their troubles
more carefully, their heart aches as much as ours, when they whisper to
themselves, “Lord, I&nbsp;believe, help thou my unbelief.”</p>

<p>Are the laity afraid of the clergy? But where is the clergyman who
would not respect honest doubt more than unquestioning faith?</p>

<p>Are the clergy afraid of the laity? But surely we know, in this place
at least, that the clear voice of honesty and humility draws more hearts
than the harsh accents of dogmatic assurance or ecclesiastic
exclusiveness.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“There lives more faith in honest doubt,</p>
<p>Believe me, than in half the creeds.”</p>
</div>

<p>A missionary must know no fear; his heart must overflow with
love&mdash;love of man, love of truth, love of God; and in this, the
highest and truest sense of the word, every Christian is, or ought to
be, a&nbsp;missionary.</p>

<p>And now, let us look again at the religions in which the missionary
spirit has been at work, and compare them with those in which any
attempt to convince others by argument, to save souls, to bear witness
to the truth, is treated with pity or scorn. <i>The former are alive,
the latter are dying or dead.</i></p>

<p>The religion of Zoroaster&mdash;the religion of Cyrus, of Darius and
Xerxes&mdash;which, but for the battles of Marathon and Salamis, might
have become the religion of the civilized world, is now professed by
only 100,000 souls&mdash;that is, by about a ten-thousandth part of the
inhabitants of the world. During the
<span class = "pagenum">250</span>
<a name = "page250" id = "page250"> </a>
last two centuries their number has steadily decreased from four to one
hundred thousand, and another century will probably exhaust what is
still left of the worshippers of the Wise Spirit, Ahura-mazda.</p>

<p>The Jews are about thirty times the number of the Parsis, and they
therefore represent a more appreciable portion of mankind. Though it is
not likely that they will ever increase in number, yet such is their
physical vigor and their intellectual tenacity, such also their pride of
race and their faith in Jehovah, that we can hardly imagine that their
patriarchal religion and their ancient customs will soon vanish from the
face of the earth.</p>

<p>But though the religions of the Parsis and Jews might justly seem to
have paid the penalty of their anti-missionary spirit, how, it will be
said, can the same be maintained with regard to the religion of the
Brahmans? That religion is still professed by at least 110,000,000 of
human souls, and, to judge from the last census, even that enormous
number falls much short of the real truth. And yet I do not shrink from
saying that their religion is dying or dead. And why? Because it cannot
stand the light of day. The worship of Śiva, of <span class =
"sanskrit">Vishṇu</span>, and the other popular deities, is of the same,
nay, in many cases of a more degraded and savage character than the
worship of Jupiter, Apollo, and Minerva; it belongs to a stratum of
thought which is long buried beneath our feet: it may live on, like the
lion and the tiger, but the mere air of free thought and civilized life
will extinguish it. A&nbsp;religion may linger on for a long time, it
may be accepted by the large masses of the people, because it is there,
and there is
<span class = "pagenum">251</span>
<a name = "page251" id = "page251"> </a>
nothing better. But when a religion has ceased to produce defenders of
the faith, prophets, champions, martyrs, it has ceased to live, in the
true sense of the word; and in that sense the old, orthodox Brahmanism
has ceased to live for more than a thousand years.</p>

<p>It is true there are millions of children, women, and men in India
who fall down before the stone image of <span class =
"sanskrit">Vishṇu</span>, with his four arms, riding on a creature half
bird, half man, or sleeping on the serpent; who worship Śiva,
a&nbsp;monster with three eyes, riding naked on a bull, with a necklace
of skulls for his ornament. There are human beings who still believe in
a god of war, Kârtikêya, with six faces, riding on a peacock, and
holding bow and arrow in his hands; and who invoke a god of success,
<span class = "sanskrit">Gaṇeśa</span>, with four hands and an
elephant’s head, sitting on a rat. Nay, it is true that, in the broad
daylight of the nineteenth century, the figure of the goddess Kali is
carried through the streets of her own city, Calcutta,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagV_10" id = "tagV_10" href = "#noteV_10">10</a> her wild
disheveled hair reaching to her feet, with a necklace of human heads,
her tongue protruded from her mouth, her girdle stained with blood. All
this is true; but ask any Hindu who can read and write and think,
whether these are the gods he believes in, and he will smile at your
credulity. How long this living death of national religion in India may
last, no one can tell: for our purposes, however, for gaining an idea of
the issue of the great religious struggle of the future, that religion
too is dead and gone.</p>

<p>The three religions which are alive, and between
<span class = "pagenum">252</span>
<a name = "page252" id = "page252"> </a>
which the decisive battle for the dominion of the world will have to be
fought, are the three missionary religions, <i>Buddhism, Mohammedanism,
and Christianity</i>. Though religious statistics are perhaps the most
uncertain of all, yet it is well to have a general conception of the
forces of our enemies; and it is well to know that, though the number of
Christians is double the number of Mohammedans, the Buddhist religion
still occupies the first place in the religious census of mankind.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_11" id = "tagV_11" href =
"#noteV_11">11</a></p>

<p>Buddhism rules supreme in Central, Northern, Eastern, and Southern
Asia, and it gradually absorbs whatever there is left of aboriginal
heathenism in that vast and populous area.</p>

<p>Mohammedanism claims as its own Arabia, Persia, great parts of India,
Asia Minor, Turkey, and Egypt; and its greatest conquests by missionary
efforts are made among the heathen population of Africa.</p>

<p>Christianity reigns in Europe and America, and it is conquering the
native races of Polynesia and Melanesia, while its missionary outposts
are scattered all over the world.</p>

<p>Between these three powers, then, the religious battle of the future,
the Holy War of mankind, will have to be fought, and is being fought at
the present moment, though apparently with little effect. To convert a
Mohammedan is difficult; to convert a Buddhist, more difficult still; to
convert a Christian, let us hope, well nigh impossible.</p>

<p>What then, it may be asked, is the use of missionaries? Why should we
spend millions on foreign missions, when there are children in our
cities who
<span class = "pagenum">253</span>
<a name = "page253" id = "page253"> </a>
are allowed to grow up in ignorance? Why should we deprive ourselves of
some of the noblest, boldest, most ardent and devoted spirits and send
them into the wilderness, while so many laborers are wanted in the
vineyard at home.</p>

<p>It is right to ask these questions; and we ought not to blame those
political economists who tell us that every convert costs us £200, and
that at the present rate of progress it would take more than 200,000
years to evangelize the world. There is nothing at all startling in
these figures. Every child born in Europe is as much a heathen as the
child of a Melanesian cannibal; and it costs us more than £200 to turn a
child into a Christian man. The other calculation is totally erroneous;
for an intellectual harvest must not be calculated by adding simply
grain to grain, but by counting each grain as a living seed, that will
bring forth fruit a hundred and a thousand fold.</p>

<p>If we want to know what work there is for the missionary to do, what
results we may expect from it, we must distinguish between two kinds of
work: the one is <i>parental</i>, the other <i>controversial</i>. Among
uncivilized races the work of the missionary is the work of a parent;
whether his pupils are young in years or old, he has to treat them with
a parent’s love, to teach them with a parent’s authority; he has to win
them, not to argue with them. I&nbsp;know this kind of missionary work
is often despised; it is called mere religious kidnapping; and it is
said that missionary success obtained by such means proves nothing for
the truth of Christianity; that the child handed over to a Mohammedan
would grow up a Mohammedan, as much as a child taken by a Christian
<span class = "pagenum">254</span>
<a name = "page254" id = "page254"> </a>
missionary becomes a Christian. All this is true; missionary success
obtained by such means proves nothing for the truth of our creeds: but
it proves, what is far more important, it proves Christian love. Read
only the “Life of Patteson,” the bishop of Melanesia; follow him in his
vessel, sailing from island to island, begging for children, carrying
them off as a mother her new-born child, nursing them, washing and
combing them, clothing them, feeding them, teaching them in his
Episcopal Palace, in which he himself is everything, nurse, and
housemaid, and cook, schoolmaster, physician, and bishop&mdash;read
there, how that man who tore himself away from his aged father, from his
friends, from his favorite studies and pursuits, had the most loving of
hearts for these children, how indignantly he repelled for them the name
of savages, how he trusted them, respected them, honored them, and when
they were formed and established, took them back to their island home,
there to be a leaven for future ages. Yes, read the life, the work, the
death of that man, a&nbsp;death in very truth, a&nbsp;ransom for the
sins of others&mdash;and then say whether you would like to suppress a
profession that can call forth such self-denial, such heroism, such
sanctity, such love. It has been my privilege to have known some of the
finest and noblest spirits which England has produced during this
century, but there is none to whose memory I look up with greater
reverence, none by whose friendship I feel more deeply humbled than by
that of that true saint, that true martyr, that truly parental
missionary.</p>

<p>The work of the parental missionary is clear, and its success
undeniable, not only in Polynesia and
<span class = "pagenum">255</span>
<a name = "page255" id = "page255"> </a>
Melanesia, but in many parts of India&mdash;(think only of the bright
light of Tinnevelly)&mdash;in Africa, in China, in America, in Syria, in
Turkey, aye, in the very heart of London.</p>

<p>The case is different with the controversial missionary, who has to
attack the faith of men brought up in other religions, in religions
which contain much truth, though mixed up with much error. Here the
difficulties are immense, the results very discouraging. Nor need we
wonder at this. We know, each of us, but too well, how little argument
avails in theological discussion; how often it produces the very
opposite result of what we expected; confirming rather than shaking
opinions no less erroneous, no less indefensible, than many articles of
the Mohammedan or Buddhist faith.</p>

<p>And even when argument proves successful, when it forces a verdict
from an unwilling judge, how often has the result been disappointing;
because in tearing up the rotten stem on which the tree rested, its
tenderest fibres have been injured, its roots unsettled, its life
destroyed.</p>

<p>We have little ground to expect that these controversial weapons will
carry the day in the struggle between the three great religions of the
world.</p>

<p>But there is a third kind of missionary activity, which has produced
the most important results, and through which alone, I&nbsp;believe, the
final victory will be gained. Whenever two religions are brought into
contact, when members of each live together in peace, abstaining from
all direct attempts at conversion, whether by force or by argument,
though conscious all the time of the fact that they and their religion
are on their trial, that they are being watched, that
<span class = "pagenum">256</span>
<a name = "page256" id = "page256"> </a>
they are responsible for all they say and do&mdash;the effect has always
been the greatest blessing to both. It calls out all the best elements
in each, and at the same time keeps under all that is felt to be of
doubtful value, of uncertain truth. Whenever this has happened in the
history of the world, it has generally led either to the reform of both
systems, or to the foundation of a new religion.</p>

<p>When after the conquest of India the violent measures for the
conversion of the Hindus to Mohammedanism had ceased, and Mohammedans
and Brahmans lived together in the enjoyment of perfect equality, the
result was a purified Mohammedanism, and a purified Brahmanism.<a class
= "tag" name = "tagV_12" id = "tagV_12" href = "#noteV_12">12</a> The
worshippers of <span class = "sanskrit">Vishṇu</span>, Śiva, and other
deities became ashamed of these mythological gods, and were led to admit
that there was, either over and above these individual deities, or
instead of them, a&nbsp;higher divine power (the Para-Brahma), the true
source of all being, the only and almighty ruler of the world. That
religious movement assumed its most important development at the
beginning of the twelfth century, when Râmânuja founded the reformed
sect of the worshippers of <span class = "sanskrit">Vishṇu</span>; and
again, in the fourteenth century, when his fifth successor, Râmânanda,
imparted a still more liberal character to that powerful sect. Not only
did he abolish many of the restrictions of caste, many of the minute
ceremonial observances in eating, drinking, and bathing, but he replaced
the classical Sanskrit&mdash;which was unintelligible to the large
masses of the people&mdash;by the living vernaculars, in which he
preached a purer worship of God.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">257</span>
<a name = "page257" id = "page257"> </a>
<p>The most remarkable man of that time was a weaver, the pupil of
Râmânanda, known by the name of Kabir. He indeed deserved the name which
the members of the reformed sect claimed for themselves, Avadhûta, which
means one who has shaken off the dust of superstition. He broke entirely
with the popular mythology and the customs of the ceremonial law, and
addressed himself alike to Hindu and Mohammedan. According to him, there
is but one God, the creator of the world, without beginning and end, of
inconceivable purity, and irresistible strength. The pure man is the
image of God, and after death attains community with God. The
commandments of Kabir are few: Not to injure anything that has life, for
life is of God; to speak the truth; to keep aloof from the world; to
obey the teacher. His poetry is most beautiful, hardly surpassed in any
other language.</p>

<p>Still more important in the history of India was the reform of Nânak,
the founder of the Sikh religion. He, too, worked entirely in the spirit
of Kabir. Both labored to persuade the Hindus and Mohammedans that the
truly essential parts of their creeds were the same, that they ought to
discard the varieties of practical detail, and the corruptions of their
teachers, for the worship of the <i>One Only Supreme</i>, whether he was
termed Allah or <span class = "sanskrit">Vishṇu</span>.</p>

<p>The effect of these religious reforms has been highly beneficial; it
has cut into the very roots of idolatry, and has spread throughout India
an intelligent and spiritual worship, which may at any time develop into
a higher national creed.</p>

<p>The same effect which Mohammedanism produced on Hinduism is now being
produced, in a much
<span class = "pagenum">258</span>
<a name = "page258" id = "page258"> </a>
higher degree, on the religious mind of India by the mere presence of
Christianity. That silent influence began to tell many years ago, even
at a time when no missionaries were allowed within the territory of the
old East India Company. Its first representative was Ram Mohun Roy, born
just one hundred years ago, in 1772, who died at Bristol in 1833, the
founder of the Brahma-Samâj. A&nbsp;man so highly cultivated and so
highly religious as he was, could not but feel humiliated at the
spectacle which the popular religion of his country presented to his
English friends. He drew their attention to the fact that there was a
purer religion to be found in the old sacred writings of his people, the
Vedas. He went so far as to claim for the Vedas a divine origin, and to
attempt the foundation of a reformed faith on their authority. In this
attempt he failed.</p>

<p>No doubt the Vedas and other works of the ancient poets and prophets
of India, contain treasures of truth, which ought never to be forgotten,
least of all by the sons of India. The late good Bishop Cotton, in his
address to the students of a missionary institution at Calcutta, advised
them to use a certain hymn of the Rig-Veda in their daily prayers.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_13" id = "tagV_13" href = "#noteV_13">13</a>
Nowhere do we find stronger arguments against idolatry, nowhere has the
unity of the Deity been upheld more strenuously against the errors of
polytheism than by some of the ancient sages of India. Even in the
oldest of their sacred books, the Rig-Veda, composed three or four
thousand years ago&mdash;where we find hymns addressed to the different
deities of the sky, the air, the earth, the rivers&mdash;the protest of
the human heart against many gods, breaks forth from time to
<span class = "pagenum">259</span>
<a name = "page259" id = "page259"> </a>
time with no uncertain sound. One poet, after he has asked to whom
sacrifice is due, answers, “to Him who is God above all gods.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagV_14" id = "tagV_14" href = "#noteV_14">14</a> Another
poet, after enumerating the names of many deities, affirms, without
hesitation, that “these are all but names of Him who is One.” And even
when single deities are invoked, it is not difficult to see that, in the
mind of the poet, each one of the names is meant to express the highest
conception of deity of which the human mind was <i>then</i> capable. The
god of the sky is called Father and Mother and Friend; he is the
Creator, the Upholder of the Universe; he rewards virtue and punishes
sin; he listens to the prayers of those who love him.</p>

<p>But granting all this, we may well understand why an attempt to claim
for these books a divine origin, and thus to make them an artificial
foundation for a new religion, failed. The successor of Ram Mohun Roy,
the present head of the Brahma-Samâj, the wise and excellent
Debendranâth Tagore, was for a time even more decided in holding to the
Vedas as the sole foundation of the new faith. But this could not last.
As soon as the true character of the Vedas,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_15" id = "tagV_15" href = "#noteV_15">15</a> which but few people
in India can understand, became known, partly through the efforts of
native, partly of European scholars, the Indian reformers relinquished
the claim of divine inspiration in favor of their Vedas, and were
satisfied with a selection of passages from the works of the ancient
sages of India, to express and embody the creed which the members of the
Brahma-Samâj hold in common.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_16" id =
"tagV_16" href = "#noteV_16">16</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum">260</span>
<a name = "page260" id = "page260"> </a>
<p>The work which these religious reformers have been doing in India is
excellent, and those only who know what it is, in religious matters, to
break with the past, to forsake the established custom of a nation, to
oppose the rush of public opinion, to brave adverse criticism, to submit
to social persecution, can form any idea of what those men have
suffered, in bearing witness to the truth that was within them.</p>

<p>They could not reckon on any sympathy on the part of Christian
missionaries; nor did their work attract much attention in Europe till
very lately, when a schism broke out in the Brahma-Samâj between the old
conservative party and a new party, led by Keshub Chunder Sen. The
former, though willing to surrender all that was clearly idolatrous in
the ancient religion and customs of India, wished to retain all that
might safely be retained: it did not wish to see the religion of India
denationalized. The other party, inspired and led by Keshub Chunder Sen,
went further in their zeal for religious purity. All that smacked of the
old leaven was to be surrendered; not only caste, but even that sacred
cord&mdash;the religious riband which makes and marks the Brahman, which
is to remind him at every moment of his life, and whatever work he may
be engaged in, of his God, of his ancestors, and of his
children&mdash;even that was to be abandoned; and instead of founding
their creed exclusively on the utterances of the ancient sages of their
own country, all that was best in the sacred books of the whole world
was selected and formed into a new sacred code.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_17" id = "tagV_17" href = "#noteV_17">17,</a><a class = "tag" href
= "#chapV_noteB">B</a></p>

<p>The schism between these two parties is deeply to be deplored; but it
is a sign of life. It augurs success
<span class = "pagenum">261</span>
<a name = "page261" id = "page261"> </a>
rather than failure for the future. It is the same schism which St. Paul
had to heal in the Church of Corinth, and he healed it with the words,
so often misunderstood, “Knowledge puffeth up, but charity
edifieth.”</p>

<p>In the eyes of our missionaries this religious reform in India has
not found much favor: nor need we wonder at this. Their object is to
transplant, if possible, Christianity in its full integrity from England
to India, as we might wish to transplant a full-grown tree. They do not
deny the moral worth, the noble aspirations, the self-sacrificing zeal
of these native reformers; but they fear that all this will but increase
their dangerous influence, and retard the progress of Christianity, by
drawing some of the best minds of India, that might have been gained
over to our religion, into a different current. They feel towards Keshub
Chunder Sen<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_18" id = "tagV_18" href =
"#noteV_18">18,</a><a class = "tag" href = "#chapV_noteC">C</a> as
Athanasius might have felt towards Ulfilas, the Arian Bishop of the
Goths: and yet, what would have become of Christianity in Europe but for
those Gothic races, but for those Arian heretics, who were considered
more dangerous than downright pagans?</p>

<p>If we think of the future of India, and of the influence which that
country has always exercised on the East, the movement of religious
reform which is now going on appears to my mind the most momentous in
this momentous century. If our missionaries feel constrained to
repudiate it as their own work, history will be more just to them than
they themselves.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_19" id = "tagV_19" href =

<span class = "pagenum">262</span>

And if not as the work of Christian missionaries, it will be recognized
hereafter as the work of those missionary Christians who have lived in
India, as examples of a true Christian life, who have approached the
natives in a truly missionary spirit, in the spirit of truth and in the
spirit of love; whose bright presence has thawed the ice, and brought
out beneath it the old soil, ready to blossom into new life. These
Indian puritans are not against us; for all the highest purposes of life
they are with us, and we, I&nbsp;trust, with them. What would the early
Christians have said to men, outside the pale of Christianity, who spoke
of Christ and his doctrine as some of these Indian reformers? Would they
have said to them, “Unless you speak our language and think our
thoughts, unless you accept our Creed and sign our Articles, we can have
nothing in common with you.”</p>

<p>O that Christians, and particularly missionaries, would lay to heart
the words of a missionary Bishop!<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_20" id =
"tagV_20" href = "#noteV_20">20</a> “I&nbsp;have for years thought,”
writes Bishop Patteson, “that we seek in our missions a great deal too
much to make <i>English</i> Christians.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Evidently the heathen man is not treated fairly, if we encumber our
message with unnecessary requirements. The ancient Church had its
‘selection of fundamentals.’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Any one can see what
mistakes we have made in India.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Few men think
themselves into the state of the Eastern mind.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We
seek to denationalize
<span class = "pagenum">263</span>
<a name = "page263" id = "page263"> </a>
these races, as far as I can see; whereas we ought surely to change as
little as possible&mdash;only what is clearly incompatible with the
simplest form of Christian teaching and practice. I&nbsp;do not mean
that we are to compromise truth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but do we not
overlay it a good deal with human traditions!”</p>

<p>If we had many such missionaries as Bishop Patteson and Bishop
Cotton, if Christianity were not only preached, but lived in that
spirit, it would then prove itself what it is&mdash;the religion of
humanity at large, large enough itself to take in all shades and
diversities of character and race.</p>

<p>And more than that&mdash;if this true missionary spirit, this spirit
of truth and love, of forbearance, of trust, of toleration, of humility,
were once to kindle the hearts of all those chivalrous ambassadors of
Christ, the message of the Gospel which they have to deliver would then
become as great a blessing to the giver as to the receiver. Even now,
missionary work unites, both at home and abroad, those who are widely
separated by the barriers of theological sects.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_21" id = "tagV_21" href = "#noteV_21">21</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum">264</span>
<a name = "page264" id = "page264"> </a>
<p>It might do so far more still. When we stand before a common enemy,
we soon forget our own small feuds. But why? Often, I&nbsp;fear, from
motives of prudence only and selfishness. Can we not, then, if we stand
in spirit before a common friend&mdash;can we not, before the face of
God, forget our small feuds, for very shame? If missionaries admit to
their fold converts who can hardly understand the equivocal abstractions
of our creeds and formulas, is it necessary to exclude those who
understand them but too well to submit the wings of their free spirit to
such galling chains! When we try to think of the majesty of God, what
are all those formulas but the stammerings of children, which only a
loving father can interpret and understand! The fundamentals of our
religion are not in these poor creeds; true Christianity lives, not in
our belief, but in our love&mdash;<i>in our love of God, and in our love
of man, founded on our love of God</i>.</p>

<p>That is the whole Law and the Prophets, that is the religion to be
preached to the whole world, that is the Gospel which will conquer all
other religions&mdash;even Buddhism and Mohammedanism&mdash;which will
win the hearts of all men.</p>

<p>There can never be too much love, though there may be too much
faith&mdash;particularly when it leads to the requirement of exactly the
same measure of faith in others. Let those who wish for the true
<span class = "pagenum">265</span>
<a name = "page265" id = "page265"> </a>
success of missionary work learn to throw in of the abundance of their
faith; let them learn to demand less from others than from themselves.
That is the best offering, the most valuable contribution which they can
make to-day to the missionary cause.</p>

<p>Let missionaries preach the Gospel again as it was preached when it
began the conquest of the Roman Empire and the Gothic nations; when it
had to struggle with powers and principalities, with time-honored
religions and triumphant philosophies, with pride of civilization and
savagery of life&mdash;and yet came out victorious. At that time
conversion was not a question to be settled by the acceptance or
rejection of certain formulas or articles; a&nbsp;simple prayer was
often enough: “God be merciful to me a sinner.”</p>

<p>There is one kind of faith that revels in words, there is another
that can hardly find utterance: the former is like riches that come to
us by inheritance; the latter is like the daily bread, which each of us
has to win in the sweat of his brow. We cannot expect the former from
new converts; we ought not to expect it or to exact it, for fear that it
might lead to hypocrisy or superstition. The mere believing of miracles,
the mere repeating of formulas requires no effort in converts, brought
up to believe in the <span class = "sanskrit">Purâṇas</span> of the
Brahmans or the Buddhist Jâtakas. They find it much easier to accept a
legend than to love God, to repeat a creed than to forgive their
enemies. In this respect they are exactly like ourselves. Let
missionaries remember that the Christian faith at home is no longer what
it was, and that it is impossible to have one Creed to preach abroad,
another to preach at home. Much that was formerly
<span class = "pagenum">266</span>
<a name = "page266" id = "page266"> </a>
considered as essential is now neglected; much that was formerly
neglected is now considered as essential. I&nbsp;think of the laity more
than of the clergy; but what would the clergy be without the laity?
There are many of our best men, men of the greatest power and influence
in literature, science, art, politics, aye even in the Church itself,
who are no longer Christian in the old sense of the word. Some imagine
they have ceased to be Christians altogether, because they feel that
they cannot believe as much as others profess to believe. We cannot
afford to lose these men, nor shall we lose them if we learn to be
satisfied with what satisfied Christ and the Apostles, with what
satisfies many a hard-working missionary. If Christianity is to retain
its hold on Europe and America, if it is to conquer in the Holy War of
the future, it must throw off its heavy armor, the helmet of brass and
the coat of mail, and face the world like David, with his staff, his
stones, and his sling. We want less of creeds, but more of trust; less
of ceremony, but more of work; less of solemnity, but more of genial
honesty; less of doctrine, but more of love. There is a faith, as small
as a grain of mustard-seed, but that grain alone can move mountains, and
more than that, it can move hearts. Whatever the world may say of us, of
us of little faith, let us remember that there was one who accepted the
offering of the poor widow. She threw in but two mites, but that was all
she had, even all her living.</p>

<p>Hardy, in his “Manual of Buddhism” (p. 187), relates how fifty-four
princes and a thousand fire-worshippers became the disciples of Buddha.
“Whilst Buddha remained at Isipatana, Yasa, the son of Sujatá, who had
been brought up in all delicacy, one night went secretly to him, was
received with affection, became a priest, and entered the first path.
The father, on discovering that he had fled, was disconsolate: but
Buddha delivered to him a discourse, by which he became a rahat. The
fifty-four companions of Yasa went to the monastery to induce him to
return, and play with them as usual; but when they saw him, they were so
struck with his manner and appearance, that they also resolved on
becoming priests. When they went to Buddha, they were admitted, by the
power of <em>irdhi</em> received the <em>pirikara</em> requisites of the
priesthood, and became rahats. Buddha had now sixty disciples who were
rahats, and he commanded them to go by different ways, and proclaim to
all that a supreme Buddha had appeared in the world.”</p>

<p>Mr. Childers has kindly sent me the following extract from Fausböll’s
“Dhammapada” (p.&nbsp;119), where the same story is <span class =

young nobleman Yasa was ripe for conversion, in the night, when weary
with the vanities of the world he had left his home and embraced the
ascetic life,&mdash;he called him, saying, ‘Follow me, Yasa,’ and that
very night he caused him to obtain the fruition of the first path, and
on the following day arhatship. And fifty-four other persons, who were
friends of Yasa’s, he ordained with the formula, ‘Follow me, priest,’
and caused them to attain arhatship. Thus when there were sixty-one
arhats in the world, having passed the period of seclusion during the
rains and resumed active duties, he sent forth the sixty priests in all
directions, saying, ‘Go forth, priests, on your rounds
(or&nbsp;travels).’”</p>

<p>Another passage, too, showing Buddha’s desire to see his doctrine
preached in the whole world, was pointed out to me by Mr. Childers from
the “Mahâparinibbâna Sutta,” which has since been published by this
indefatigable scholar in the “Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,”
vol. vii., <span class = "locked">p.&nbsp;77:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Three months before his death, when Gautama’s health and strength is
fast failing, he is tempted by Mâra, who comes to him and urges him to
bring his life and mission at once to a close by attaining <span class =
"sanskrit">Nirvâṇa</span> (dying). Buddha replies that he will not die
until his disciples are perfect on all points, and able to maintain the
Truth with power against all unbelievers. Mâra replies that this is
already the case, whereupon Buddha uses these striking words: <span

‘O&nbsp;wicked one, I&nbsp;will not die until this my holy religion
thrives and prospers, until it is widely spread, known to many peoples,
and grown great, until it is completely published among men.’ Mara again
asserts that this is already the case, and Buddha replies, ‘Strive no
more, wicked one, the death of the Tathagata is at hand, at the end of
three months from this time, the Tathâgata will attain <span class =

<a class = "tag" href = "#tagV_17">text</a></h5>

<div class = "notes">

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> present position of the two
parties in the Brahma-Samâj is well described by Rajnarain Bose (the
“Adi Brahmo Samaj,” Calcutta, 1873, p.&nbsp;11). “The particular
opinions above referred to can be divided into two comprehensive
classes&mdash;conservative and progressive. The conservative Brahmos are
those who are unwilling to push religious and social reformation to any
great extreme. They are of opinion that reformation should be gradual,
the law of gradual progress being universally prevalent in nature. They
also say that the principle of Brahmic harmony requires a harmonious
discharge of all our duties, and that, as it is a duty to take a part in
reformation, so there are other duties to perform, namely, those towards
parents and society, and that we should harmonize all these duties as
much as we can. However unsatisfactory such arguments may appear to a
progressive Brahmo, they are such as could not be slighted at first
sight. They are certainly such as to make the conservative Brahmo think
sincerely that he is justified in not pushing religious and social
reformation to any great extreme. The progressive Brahmo cannot
therefore call him a hypocrite. A&nbsp;union of both the conservative
and the progressive elements in the Brahmo church is necessary for its
stability. The conservative element will prevent the progressive from
spoiling the cause of reformation by taking premature and abortive
measures for advancing that cause; the progressive element will prevent
the conservative from proving a stolid obstruction to it. The
conservative element will serve as a link between the progressive
element and the orthodox community, and prevent the progressive Brahmo
from being completely estranged from that community, as the native
Christians are; while the progressive element will prevent the
conservative from remaining inert and being absorbed by the orthodox
community. The common interests of Brahmo Dharma
<span class = "pagenum">270</span>
<a name = "page270" id = "page270"> </a>
should lead both classes to respect, and be on amicable terms with each
other. It is true the progressive of the present half century will prove
the conservative of the next; but there could never come a time when the
two classes would cease to exist in the bosom of the church. She should,
like a wise mother, make them live in peace with each other, and work
harmoniously together for her benefit.</p>

<p>“As idolatry is intimately interwoven with our social fabric,
conservative Brahmos, though discarding it in other respects, find it
very difficult to do so on the occasion of such very important domestic
ceremonies as marriage, <em>shradh</em> (ancestral sacrifices), and
<em>upanayana</em> (spiritual apprenticing); but they should consider
that Brahmoism is not so imperative on any other point as on the
renunciation of idolatry. It can allow conservatism in other respects,
but not on the point of idolatry. It can consider a man a Brahmo if he
be conservative in other respects than idolatry; but it can never
consider an idolater to be a Brahmo. The conservative Brahmo can do one
thing, that is, observe the old ritual, leaving out only the idolatrous
portion of it, if he do not choose to follow the positive Brahmo ritual
laid down in the ‘Anushthána Paddhati.’ Liberty should be given by the
progressive Brahmo to the conservative Brahmo in judging of the
idolatrous character of the portions of the old ritual rejected by him.
If a progressive Brahmo requires a conservative one to reject those
portions which the former considers to be idolatrous, but the latter
does not, he denies liberty of conscience to a fellow-Brahmo.</p>

<p>“The Adi Brahmo-Samaj is the national Hindu Theistic Church, whose
principles of church reformation we have been describing above. Its
demeanor towards the old religion of the country is friendly, but
corrective and reformative. It is this circumstance which preëminently
distinguishes it from the Brahmo-Samaj of India, whose attitude to that
religion is antagonistic and offensive. The mission of the Adi Samaj is
to fulfill the old religion, and not to destroy it. The attitude of the
Adi Samaj to the old religion is friendly, but it is not at the same
time opposed to progress. It is a mistake to call it a conservative
church. It is rather a conservative-progressive church, or, more
correctly, simply a church or religious body, leaving matters of social
reformation to the judgments of individual members or bodies of such
members. It contains both progressive and conservative
<span class = "pagenum">271</span>
<a name = "page271" id = "page271"> </a>
members. As the ultra-progressive Brahmos, who wanted to eliminate the
conservative element from it, were obliged to secede from it, so if a
high conservative party arise in its bosom which would attempt to do
violence to the progressive element and convert the church into a partly
conservative one, that party also would be obliged to secede from it.
Only men who can be tolerant of each others opinions, and can respect
each others earnest convictions, progressive and conservative, can
remain its members.”</p>

<p>The strong national feeling of the Indian reformers finds expression
in the following passage from “Brahmic Questions,” <span class =
"locked">p.&nbsp;9:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“A Samaj is accessible to all. The minds of the majority of our
countrymen are not deeply saturated with Christian sentiments. What
would they think of a Brahmo minister who would quote on the Vedi
(altar) sayings from the Bible? Would they not from that time conceive
an intolerable hatred towards Brahmoism and everything Brahmo? If
quoting a sentence from the Bible or Koran offend our countrymen, we
shall not do so. Truth is as catholic when taken from the Sâstras as
from the Koran or the Bible. True liberality consists, not in quoting
texts from the religious Scriptures of other nations, but in bringing
up, as we advance, the rear who are groveling in ignorance and
superstition. We certainly do not act against the dictates of
conscience, if we quote texts from the Hindu Sâstras only, and not from
all the religious Scriptures of all the countries on the face of the
globe. Moreover, there is not a single saying in the Scriptures of other
nations, which has not its counterpart in the Sâstras.”</p>

<p>And again in “The Adi Brahma-Samaj, its Views and Principles,” <span
class = "locked">p.&nbsp;1:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The members of the Adi Samaj, aiming to diffuse the truths of Theism
among their own nation, the Hindus, have naturally adopted a Hindu mode
of propagation, just as an Arab Theist would adopt an Arabian mode of
propagation, and a Chinese Theist a Chinese one. Such differences in the
aspect of Theism in different countries must naturally arise from the
usual course of things, but they are adventitious, not essential,
national, not sectarian. Although Brahmoism is universal religion, it is
impossible to communicate a universal form to it. It must wear a
particular form in a particular country. A&nbsp;so-called universal
<span class = "pagenum">272</span>
<a name = "page272" id = "page272"> </a>
form would make it appear grotesque and ridiculous to the nation or
religious denomination among whom it is intended to be propagated, and
would not command their veneration. In conformity with such views, the
Adi Samaj has adopted a Hindu form to propagate Theism among Hindus. It
has therefore retained many innocent Hindu usages and customs, and has
adopted a form of divine service containing passages extracted from the
Hindu Sâstras only, a&nbsp;book of Theistic texts containing selections
from those sacred books only, and a ritual containing as much of the
ancient form as could be kept consistently with the dictates of
conscience.”</p>

Extracts from Keshub Chunder Sen’s Lecture on Christ and Christianity,
1870.</h5>

<div class = "notes">

<p><span class = "firstword">“Why</span> have I cherished respect and
reverence for Christ? . . . Why is it that, though I do not take the
name of ‘Christian,’ I&nbsp;still persevere in offering my hearty
thanksgivings to Jesus Christ? There must be something in the life and
death of Christ,&mdash;there must be something in his great gospel which
tends to bring comfort and light and strength to a heart heavy-laden
with iniquity and wickedness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I studied Christ
ethically, nay spiritually,&mdash;and I studied the Bible also in the
same spirit, and I must acknowledge candidly and sincerely that I owe a
great deal to Christ and to the gospel of
Christ.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“My first inquiry was, What is the creed taught in the Bible?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Must I go through all the dogmas and doctrines which
constitute Christianity in the eye of the various sects, or is there
something simple which I can at once grasp and turn to account?</p>

<p>“I found Christ spoke one language, and Christianity another.
I&nbsp;went to him prepared to hear what he had to say, and was
immensely gratified when he told me: ‘Love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, with all thy mind, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength,
and love thy neighbor as thyself;’ and then he added, ‘This is the whole
law and the prophets,’ in other words, the whole philosophy, theology,
and ethics of the law and the prophets are concentrated in these two
great doctrines of love to God and love to man; and then elsewhere he
said, ‘This do and
<span class = "pagenum">273</span>
<a name = "page273" id = "page273"> </a>
ye shall inherit everlasting life.’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If we love God and
love man we become Christ-like, and so attain everlasting life.</p>

<p>“Christ never demanded from me worship or adoration that is due to
God, the Creator of the Universe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He places himself
before me as the spirit I must imbibe in order to approach the Divine
Father, as the great Teacher and guide who will lead me to God.</p>

<p>“There are some persons who believe that if we pass through the
ceremony of baptism and sacrament, we shall be accepted by God, but if
you accept baptism as an outward rite, you cannot thereby render your
life acceptable to God, for Christ wants something internal,
a&nbsp;complete conversion of the heart, a&nbsp;giving up the yoke of
mammon and accepting the yoke of religion, and truth, and God. He wants
us to baptize our hearts not with cold water, but with the fire of
religious and spiritual enthusiasm; he calls upon us not to go through
any outward rite, but to make baptism a ceremony of the heart,
a&nbsp;spiritual enkindling of all our energies, of all our loftiest and
most heavenly aspirations and activities. That is true baptism. So with
regard to the doctrine of the sacrament. There are many who eat the
bread and drink the wine at the sacramental table, and go through the
ceremony in the most pious and fervent spirit; but, after all, what does
the sacrament mean? If men simply adopt it as a tribute of respect and
honor to Christ, shall he be satisfied? Shall they themselves be
satisfied? Can we look upon them as Christians simply because they have
gone through this rite regularly for twenty or fifty years of their
lives? I&nbsp;think not. Christ demands of us absolute sanctification
and purification of the heart. In this matter, also, I&nbsp;see Christ
on one side, and Christian sects on the other.</p>

<p>“What is that bread which Christ asked his disciples to eat? what
that wine which he asked them to taste? Any man who has simple
intelligence in him, would at once come to the conclusion that all this
was metaphorical, and highly and eminently spiritual. Now, are you
prepared to accept Christ simply as an outward Christ, an outward
teacher, an external atonement and propitiation, or will you prove true
to Christ by accepting his solemn injunctions in their spiritual
importance and weight? He distinctly says, every follower of his must
eat his flesh and drink his blood. If we eat, bread is converted into
strength and health, and becomes the means of prolonging our life; so,
spiritually,
<span class = "pagenum">274</span>
<a name = "page274" id = "page274"> </a>
if we take truth into our heart, if we put Christ into the soul, we
assimilate the spirit of Christ to our spiritual being, and then we find
Christ incorporated into our existence and converted into spiritual
strength, and health, and joy, and blessedness. Christ wants something
that will amount to self-sacrifice, a&nbsp;casting away of the old man,
and a new growth in the heart. I&nbsp;thus draw a line of demarcation
between the visible and outward Christ, and the invisible and inward
Christ, between bodily Christ and spiritual Christ, between the Christ
of images and pictures, and the Christ that grows in the heart, between
dead Christ and living Christ, between Christ that lived and that was,
and Christ that does live and that is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“To be a Christian then is to be Christ-like. Christianity means
becoming like Christ, not acceptance of Christ as a proposition or as an
outward representation, but spiritual conformity with the life and
character of Christ. And what is Christ? By Christ I understand one who
said, ‘Thy will be done;’ and when I talk of Christ, I&nbsp;talk of that
spirit of loyalty to God, that spirit of absolute determinedness and
preparedness to say at all times and in all circumstances, ‘Thy will be
done, not mine.’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“This prayer about forgiving an enemy and loving an enemy, this
transcendental doctrine of love of man, is really sweet to me, and when
I think of that blessed Man of God, crucified on the cross, and uttering
those blessed words, ‘Father, forgive them, they know not what they do;’
oh! I&nbsp;feel that I must love that being, I&nbsp;feel that there is
something within me which is touched by these sweet and heavenly
utterances, I&nbsp;feel that I must love Christ, let Christians say what
they like against me; that Christ I must love, for he preached love for
an enemy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“When every individual man becomes Christian in
spirit&mdash;repudiate the name, if you like&mdash;when every individual
man becomes as prayerful as Christ was, as loving and forgiving towards
enemies as Christ was, as self-sacrificing as Christ was, then these
little units, these little individualities, will coalesce and combine
together by the natural affinity of their hearts; and these new
creatures, reformed, regenerated, in the child-like and Christ-like
spirit of devotion and faith, will feel drawn towards each other, and
they shall constitute a real Christian church, a&nbsp;real Christian
nation. Allow me, friends, to say, England is not yet a Christian
nation.”</p>

commit sin in mind, speech, action, or understanding, performs
austerities; not he who drieth up his body.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the place of pilgrimage of the Brahmos?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The company of the good.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the Veda of the Brahmos?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Divine knowledge. It is superior to all Vedas. The Veda
itself says: The inferior knowledge is the Rig Veda, the Yajur Veda, the
Sama Veda, the Atharva Veda, etc.; the superior knowledge is that which
treats of God.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the most sacred formula of the Brahmos?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Be good and do good.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Who is the true Brahman?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He who knows Brahma. The <span class =
"sanskrit">Brihadâraṇyaka-Upanishad</span> says: He who departs from
this world knowing God, is a Brahman. (See “Brahmic Questions of the
Day,” 1869.)</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">When</span> I preached on a like occasion
last year, I spoke at some length of the prospects of Christian
missions,<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_24" id = "tagV_24" href =
"#noteV_24">24</a> and I ventured to give seven grounds which the
peculiar circumstances of our time afforded for
<span class = "pagenum">277</span>
<a name = "page277" id = "page277"> </a>
greater confidence in the future. First, the better knowledge of the
Divine nature acquired by the extinction of the once universal belief
that all heathens were everlastingly lost; secondly, the increased
acquaintance with the heathen religions themselves; thirdly, the
instruction which Christian missionaries have gained or may gain from
their actual experience in foreign parts; fourthly, the recognition of
the fact that the main hindrance to the success of Christian missions
arises from the vices and sins of Christendom; fifthly, an
acknowledgment of the indirect influences of Christianity through
legislation and civilization; sixthly, the newly awakened perception of
the duty of making exact, unvarnished, impartial statements on this
subject; seventhly, the testimony borne by missionary experience to the
common elements and essential principles of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>On these&mdash;the peculiar grounds for hope and for exertion in this
our generation&mdash;I content myself with referring to the observations
which I then made, and which I will not now repeat.</p>

<p>I propose on this occasion to make a few remarks on the End and on
the Means of Christian Missions; remarks which must of necessity be
general in their import, but which for that reason are the more suitable
to be offered by one who cannot speak from personal and special
experience.</p>

<p>The text is taken from a striking incident in the life of the
greatest of apostolic missionaries. It was in the presence of Festus and
Agrippa that Paul had poured forth those few burning utterances which to
Festus seemed like madness, but which Paul himself declared to be words
of truth and soberness. Then it
<span class = "pagenum">278</span>
<a name = "page278" id = "page278"> </a>
was that the Jewish prince, Agrippa&mdash;far better instructed and
seeing deeper into Paul’s mind than the heathen Festus, yet still
unconvinced&mdash;broke in upon the conversation with the words which in
the English translation have well nigh passed into a proverb, “Almost
thou persuadest me to be a Christian.” The sense which they thus give
would be in itself perfectly suitable to the halting, fickle character
of the Herodian family, and would accurately describe the numerous
half-converts throughout the world&mdash;“Almost,” but not quite, “thou
persuadest me to join the good cause.” But the sense which, by the
nearly universal consent of modern scholars, they really bear in the
original is something still more instructive. The only meaning of which
the Greek words are capable is an exclamation, half in jest and half in
earnest, “It is but a very brief and simple argument that you offer to
work so great a change;” or, if we may venture to bring out the sense
more forcibly, “So few words, and such a vast conclusion!” “So slight a
foundation, and so gigantic a superstructure!” “So scanty an outfit, and
so perilous an enterprise!” The speech breathes something of the spirit
of Naaman, when he was told to wash in the Jordan&mdash;“Are not Abana
and Pharpar better than all the waters of Israel?” It is like the
complaint of the popular prophets in the time of Hezekiah, whose taste
demanded stronger flavor than the noble simplicity of Isaiah, “Thou
givest us only line upon line, precept upon precept.” It breathes the
spirit of the Ephesian Christians who, when they heard St. John’s
repeated maxim of “Little children, love one another,” said, “Is this
all that he has to tell us?” It expresses the spirit of many an one
since, who has stumbled at the threshold
<span class = "pagenum">279</span>
<a name = "page279" id = "page279"> </a>
of the genuine Gospel&mdash;“So vague, so simple, so universal. Is this
worth the sacrifice that you demand? Give us a demonstrative argument,
a&nbsp;vast ceremonial, a&nbsp;complex system, a&nbsp;uniform
government. Nothing else will satisfy us.”</p>

<p>As Agrippa’s objection, so is Paul’s answer. It would have indeed
borne a good sense had he meant what in our English version he is made
to say, “I&nbsp;would that thou wert converted both ‘almost and
altogether.’ Halfness or wholeness&mdash;I admire them both. Half a soul
is better than none at all. To have come half way is better than never
to have started at all; but half is only good, because it leads towards
the whole.” Nevertheless, following the real meaning of Agrippa’s
remark, St. Paul’s retort, in fact, bears a yet deeper
significance&mdash;“I would to God, that whether by little or by much,
whether by brief arguments or by long arguments, somehow and somewhere,
the change were wrought. The means to me are comparatively nothing, so
long as the end is accomplished.” It is the same spirit as that which
dictated the noble expression in the Epistle to the Philippians: “Some
preach Christ of envy and strife, some also of good will. The one preach
Christ of contention, the other of love. What then? notwithstanding,
every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached.”<a class
= "tag" name = "tagV_25" id = "tagV_25" href = "#noteV_25">25</a></p>

<p>And then he proceeds to vindicate the end which makes him indifferent
as to the means. Agrippa, in his brief taunt, had said, “Such are the
arguments by which you would fain make me a <i>Christian</i>.” It is one
of the few, one of the only three occasions on which that glorious name
is used in the New Testament.
<span class = "pagenum">280</span>
<a name = "page280" id = "page280"> </a>
It is here charged not with the venerable meaning which we now attach to
it, but with the novel and degrading associations which it bore in the
mouth of every Jew and every Roman at that time&mdash;of Tacitus or
Josephus, no less than of Festus or Agrippa. “Is it,” so the king meant
to say, “is it that you think to make me a <i>Christian</i>, a member of
that despised, heretical, innovating sect, of which the very name is a
sufficient condemnation?”</p>

<p>It is only by bearing this in mind that we see the force of St.
Paul’s answer. He does not insist on the word; he does not fight even
for this sacred title; he does not take it up as a pugnacious champion
might take up the glove which his adversary had thrown down; he does not
say, “I&nbsp;would that thou wast a Christian.” In his answer he bears
his testimony to one of the gravest, the most fruitful, of all
theological truths&mdash;that it is not the name but the thing, not the
form but the reality, on which stress must be laid; and he gives the
most lucid, heart-stirring illustration of what the reality is.
“I&nbsp;would that not only thou, but all those who hear me were
(I&nbsp;ask for no ambiguous catchword or byword, but) what you see
before you; I&nbsp;would that you all were such as I am&mdash;such as I
am, upheld by the hopes, filled with the affections, that sustain my
charmed existence;” and then, with that exquisite courtesy which
characterizes so many traits of the Apostle’s history, glancing at the
chains which bound him to the Roman guard&mdash;“‘except these bonds.’
This, whether you call it Christian or not, is what I desire to see you
and all the world.” “You see it before you in the life, the character,
the spirit, of one who knows what Christianity is, and who wishes that
all
<span class = "pagenum">281</span>
<a name = "page281" id = "page281"> </a>
his fellow-creatures should partake of the happiness that he has gained,
repose on the same principles that give him strength.” This, then, is
the statement of the greatest of missionaries, both as to the end which
he sought to attain, and the means by which he and we should seek to
attain it.</p>

<p>I. Let us first take the End: “Such as I am, except these bonds.”
That is the state to which St. Paul desired to bring all those who heard
him. That, according to him, was the description of a Christian. No
doubt if he had been pressed yet further, he would have said that he
meant, “Such as Jesus Christ, my Lord.” But he was satisfied with taking
such a living, human, imperfect exemplification as he whom Festus and
Agrippa saw in their presence. “Such as Paul was.” Here is no ambiguous
definition, no obsolete form. What manner of man he was we know even
better than Festus or Agrippa knew. Look at him with all his
characteristic peculiarities; a&nbsp;man passionately devoted to his own
faithful friends, and clinging to the reminiscences of his race and
country, yet with a heart open to embrace all mankind; a&nbsp;man
combining the strongest convictions with an unbounded toleration of
differences, and an unbounded confidence in truth; a&nbsp;man penetrated
with the freedom of the Spirit, but with a profound appreciation of the
value of great existing institutions, whether civil or religious&mdash;a
thorough Roman citizen and a thorough Eastern gentleman; embarked on a
career of daring fortitude and endurance, undertaken in the strength of
the persuasion that in Jesus Christ of Nazareth he had seen the highest
perfection of Divine and human goodness&mdash;a Master worth living for
and worth dying for, whose Spirit was to be the
<span class = "pagenum">282</span>
<a name = "page282" id = "page282"> </a>
regenerating power of the whole world. This character, this condition it
was to which St. Paul desired that his hearers should be brought. One
only reservation he makes; “except these bonds,” except those
limitations, those circumscriptions, those vexations, those irritations,
which belonged to the suffering, toil-worn circumstances in which he was
at that moment placed.</p>

<p>Such is the aim which, following the example of their most
illustrious predecessor, all missionaries ought to have before their
eyes. To create, to preach, to exhibit those elements of character,
those apostolical graces, those Divine intuitions, which even the hard
Roman magistrate and the superficial Jewish prince recognized in Paul of
Tarsus. Where these are, there is Christianity. In proportion as any of
these are attained, in that proportion has a human being become a
Christian. Wherever and in proportion as these are not, there the
missionary’s labor has failed&mdash;there the seed has been sown to no
purpose&mdash;there the name of Christian may be, but the reality is
not.</p>

<p>This preëminence of the object of Christian missions&mdash;namely,
the formation of heroic, apostolic, and therefore Christian
characters&mdash;has a wide practical importance. In these
days&mdash;when there is so much temptation to dwell on the scaffolding,
the apparatus, the organization of religion, as though it were religion
itself&mdash;it is doubly necessary to bear in mind what true Religion
is, wherein lies the essential superiority of Christianity to all the
other forms of religion on the surface of the earth. It is not merely
the baptism of thousands of infants, such as filled a large part of the
aspirations even of so great a missionary as Francis Xavier; nor the
adoption of the
<span class = "pagenum">283</span>
<a name = "page283" id = "page283"> </a>
name of Christ, as was done on so vast a scale by the ferocious rebels
of China; nor the repetition, with ever so much accuracy, of the
Christian creed, as was done by the pretended converts from
Mahommedanism or Judaism, under the terrible compulsion of the Catholic
sovereigns of Spain. Nor is it the assurance ever so frequently
repeated, that we are saved; nor is it the absolution, ever so solemnly
pronounced by a priest; nor is it the shedding of floods of tears; nor
is it the adoption of voluntary self-degradation or solitary seclusion.
All these may be found in other religions in even greater force than in
Christianity. That which alone, if anything, stamps Christianity as the
supreme religion, is that its essence, its object, is in none of these
things, valuable as some of them may be as signs and symptoms of the
change which every mission is intended to effect. The change itself, the
end itself, Christianity itself, is at once greater and simpler. It is
to be such as Paul was; it is to produce characters, which in
truthfulness, in independence, in mercy, in purity, in charity, may
recall something of the great Apostle, even as he recalled something of
the mind which was in Christ Jesus. It was this clear vision of what he
desired to see as the fruits of his teaching that made St. Paul so ready
to admire whatsoever things were lovely and of good report wherever he
found them. In Gentile or in Jew, in heathen or in Christian, he
recognized at once the spirits kindred to his own, and welcomed them
accordingly. He felt that he could raise them yet higher; but he was
eager to claim them as his brethren even from the first.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagV_26" id = "tagV_26" href = "#noteV_26">26</a> Even in
<span class = "pagenum">284</span>
<a name = "page284" id = "page284"> </a>
the legends which surround his history there has been preserved
something of this genuine apostolic sympathy. It was a fine touch in the
ancient Latin hymn which described how, when he landed at Puteoli, he
turned aside to the hill of Pausilipo to shed a tear over the tomb of
Virgil, and thought how much he might have made of that noble soul if he
had found him still on <span class = "locked">earth:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Ad Maronis mausoleum</p>
<p>Ductus, fudit super eum</p>
<p class = "indent">Piæ rorem lacrymæ&mdash;</p>
<p>‘Quantum,’ dixit, ‘te fecissem</p>
<p>Si te vivum invenissem,</p>
<p class = "indent">Poetarum maxime.’”</p>
</div>

<p>It was this which made him cling with such affectionate interest to
his converts, to his friends, to his sons, as he calls them, in Christ
Jesus. All that he sought, all that he looked for in them, was that they
should show in their characters the seal of the spirit that animated
himself. Whether they derived this character from himself or from
Apollos or Cephas he cared not to ask. He was their pupil as much as
their master. He disclaimed all dominion over their independent faith;
he claimed only to be a helper in their joy.</p>

<p>This reproduction of Paul&mdash;this reproduction of all that is best
in ourselves or better than ourselves&mdash;in the minds and hearts of
mankind, is the true work of the Christian missionary; and, in order to
do this, he must be himself that which he wishes to impress upon them in
humility, goodness, courtesy, and holiness, except only the straitening
bonds which cramp or confine each separate character, nation, and
church. No disparager of Christian missions can dispute this
<span class = "pagenum">285</span>
<a name = "page285" id = "page285"> </a>
*&mdash;no champion of Christian missions need go beyond this. When, in
the last century, the Danish missionary, Schwarz, was pursuing his
labors at Tanjore, and the Rajah Hyder Ali desired to treat with the
English government, he said: “Do not send to me any of your agents, for
I trust neither their words nor their treaties. But send to me the
missionary of whose character I hear so much from every one; him will I
receive and trust.” That was the electrifying, vivifying effect of the
apparition of such an one as Paul&mdash;“a man who had indeed done
nothing worthy of bonds or of death”&mdash;a man in whose entire
disinterestedness and in whose transparent honor the image and
superscription of his Master was written so that no one could mistake
it. “In every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteousness” is
the noblest work of God our Creator&mdash;the most precious result of
human endeavor. If any such&mdash;by missionary efforts, either of
convert or teacher, either direct or indirect&mdash;have been produced,
then the prayers uttered, the labors inspired, the hopes expressed in
these and like services have not been altogether in vain. One of the
most striking facts to which our attention has been called as demanding
our thankfulness on this day is the solemn testimony borne by the
Government of India to the fruits of “the blameless lives and
self-denying labors of its six hundred Protestant missionaries.” And
what are those fruits? Not merely the adoption of this or that outward
form of Christianity by this or that section of the Indian community. It
is something which is in appearance less, but in reality far greater
than this. It is something less like the question of Agrippa, but more
like the answer of Paul. It is that they have “infused
<span class = "pagenum">286</span>
<a name = "page286" id = "page286"> </a>
new vigor into the stereotyped life of the vast populations placed under
English rule;” it is that they are “preparing those populations to be in
every way better men and better citizens of the great Empire under which
they dwell.” That is a verdict on which we can rest with the assurance
that it is not likely to be reversed. Individual conversions may
relapse&mdash;may be accounted for by special motives; but
long-sustained, wide-reaching changes of the whole tenor and bent of a
man or of a nation are beyond suspicion. When we see the immovable, and,
as the official document says, “the stereotyped” forms of Indian life
re-animated with a vigor unknown to the Oriental races in earlier days,
this is a regeneration as surprising as that which, to a famous
missionary of the past generation, seemed as impossible as the
restoration of a mummy to life&mdash;namely, the conversion of a single
Brahmin.</p>

<p>This, then, is the End of Christian missions, whether to heathens or
to Christians, namely, to make better men and better citizens&mdash;to
raise the whole of society by inspiring it with a higher view of duty,
with a stronger sense of truth; with a more powerful conviction that
only by goodness and truth can God be approached or Christ be
served&mdash;that God is goodness and truth, and that Christ is the
Image of God, because He is goodness and truth. If this be the
legitimate result of Christianity, no further arguments are needed to
prove that it contains a light which is worth imparting, and which,
wherever it is imparted, vindicates its heavenly origin and its heavenly
tendency.</p>

<p>II. This is the End; and now what are the Means? They are what we
might expect in the view of so
<span class = "pagenum">287</span>
<a name = "page287" id = "page287"> </a>
great an end. Anything (so&nbsp;the Apostle tells&nbsp;us), be it small
or great, short or long, scanty or ample,&mdash;the manners of a Jew for
Jews, the manners of a Gentile for Gentiles, “all things for all men,”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_27" id = "tagV_27" href =
"#noteV_27">27</a>&mdash;are worth considering if “by any of these means
he might save,” that is, elevate, sanctify, purify any of those to whom
he spoke. When we reflect upon the many various efforts to do good in
this manifold world&mdash;the multitude of sermons, societies, agencies,
excitements, which to some seem as futile and fruitless as to others
they seem precious and important&mdash;it is a true consolation to bear
in mind the Apostle’s wise and generous maxim, “Whether by little or by
much, whether in pretence or in truth, whether of strife or of good
will, Christ is preached, and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will
rejoice.” It may be by a short, sudden, electric shock, or it may be by
a long course of civilizing, humanizing tendencies. It may be by a
single text, such as that which awoke the conscience of Augustine; or a
single interview like Justin’s with the unknown philosopher; or it may
be by a long systematic treatise&mdash;Butler’s “Analogy,” or Lardner’s
“Credibilia,” or the “Institutes” of Calvin, or the “Summa Theologiæ” of
Aquinas. It may be by the sudden flush of victory in battle, such as
convinced Clovis on the field of Tolbiac; or the argument of a peaceful
conference, such as convinced our own Ethelbert. It may be by teachers
steeped in what was by half the Christian world regarded as deadly
heresy, such as the Arian Bishop Ulfilas, by whom were converted to the
faith those mighty Gothic tribes which formed the first elements of
European Christendom, and whose deeds Augustine regarded,
notwithstanding
<span class = "pagenum">288</span>
<a name = "page288" id = "page288"> </a>
their errors, as the glory of the Christian name.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_28" id = "tagV_28" href = "#noteV_28">28</a> It may be by teachers
immersed in superstitions as barbarous, as completely repudiated by the
civilized world, as were those of the famous Roman Pontiff who sent the
first missionaries to these shores. Sometimes the change has been
effected by the sight of a single picture, as when Vladimir of Russia
was shown the representation of the Last Judgment; sometimes by a dream
or a sign, known only to those who were affected by it&mdash;such as the
vision of the Cross which arrested Constantine on his way to Rome, or
changed Colonel Gardiner’s dissolute youth to a manhood of strict and
sober piety. Sometimes it has been by the earnest preaching of
missionaries, confessedly ill-educated and ill-prepared for the work
which they had to accomplish; sometimes by the slow infiltration of
Christian literature and Christian civilization; the grandeur, in old
days, of Rome and Constantinople; in our days, the superiority of
European genius, the spread of English commerce, the establishment of
just laws, pure homes, merciful institutions.</p>

<p>We do not say that all these means are equally good or equally
efficacious. St. Paul, in his argument with Agrippa, did not mean to say
that “almost and altogether,” that “much and little,” were the same; he
did not mean that it was equally good that Christ should be preached in
strife or in good-will; he did not mean that a good end justified bad
means, or that we may do evil that good may come; he did not
<span class = "pagenum">289</span>
<a name = "page289" id = "page289"> </a>
mean to justify the falsehoods which are profanely called pious frauds,
nor the persecutions which have been set on foot by those who thought to
do God service, or the attempt to stimulate artificial excitement by
undermining the moral strength and manly independence of the human
spirit. God forbid! But what he meant, and what we mean with him, is
this: In true Christian missions, in the conversion of human souls from
dead works, from sin, from folly, from barbarism, from hardness, from
selfishness, to goodness and purity, justice and truth, the field is so
vast, the diversity of character in men and nations is so infinite, the
enterprise so arduous, the aspects of Divine truth so various, that it
is on the one hand a duty for each one to follow out that particular
means of conversion which seems to him most efficacious, and on the
other hand to acquiesce in the converging use of many means which
cannot, by the nature of the case, appear equally efficacious to every
one. Such a toleration, such an adoption of the different modes of
carrying on what John Bunyan called “the Holy War,” “the Siege of Man’s
Soul,” must indeed be always controlled by the determination to keep the
high, paramount, universal end always in view; by the vigilant endeavor
to repress the exaggeration, to denounce the follies and the falsehoods
which infect even the best attempts of narrow and fallible, though good
and faithful, servants of their Lord. But, if once we have this
principle fixed in our minds, it surely becomes a solace to remember
that the soul of man is won by a thousand different
approaches&mdash;that thus the instruments which often seem most
unworthy may yet serve to produce a result far above
themselves&mdash;that when “we have toiled all
<span class = "pagenum">290</span>
<a name = "page290" id = "page290"> </a>
night and taken nothing” by keeping close to the shore, or by throwing
out our nets always on one side, yet if we have courage “to launch out
into the deep, and cast out our nets on the other side of the ship,” we
shall “enclose a great multitude of fishes, so that the net shall
break.”</p>

<p>He is a traitor to the cause who exalts the means above the end, or
who seeks an end altogether different from that to which his allegiance
binds him; but he is not a traitor, but a faithful soldier, who makes
the best use of all the means that are placed in his hands. Long after
the imperfect instruments have perished the results will endure, and in
forms wholly unlike the insufficiency or the meagreness of the first
propelling cause. The preaching of Henry Martyn may have been tinged by
a zeal often not according to knowledge; but the savor of his holy and
self-denying life has passed like a sweet-smelling incense through the
whole framework of Indian society. “Even,” so he said himself, “if I
should never see a native converted, God may design by my patience and
continuance in the work to encourage future missionaries.”</p>

<p>The more profoundly we are impressed with the degradation of the
heathen nations, with the corruption of the Christian churches, the more
thankful should we be for any attempts, however slight and however
various, to quicken the sluggish mass, and enlighten the blackness of
the night, provided only that the mass is permanently quickened, and the
darkness is in any measure dispelled. “I&nbsp;have lived too long,” said
Lord Macaulay on his return from India to England, “I&nbsp;have lived
too long in a country where people worship cows, to think much of the

differences which part Christians from Christians.” And, in fact, as the
official report to which I have referred testifies in strong terms, the
presence of the great evils which Indian missionaries have to confront,
has often produced in them a noble and truly Christian indifference to
the trivial divergences between themselves. “Even a one-eyed man,” says
the proverb, “is a king amongst the blind.” Even the shepherd’s sling
may perchance smite down the Goliath of Gath. The rough sledge-hammer of
a rustic preacher may strike home, where the most polished scholar would
plead in vain. The calm judgment of the wise and good, or the silent
example, or the understanding sympathy, or the wide survey of the whole
field of the religions of mankind, may awaken convictions which all the
declamations of all the churches would fail to arouse.</p>

<p>The misery of the war on the coast of Africa, the terrible prospect
of the Indian famine, may furnish the very opening which we most desire.
They may be the very touchstones by which these suffering heathens will
test the practical efficiency of a Christian government and a Christian
nation, of Christian missionaries and Christian people, and, having so
tested it, will judge.</p>

<p>When the first Napoleon suddenly found himself among the quicksands
of the Red Sea he ordered his generals to ride out in so many opposite
directions, and the first who arrived on firm ground to call on the rest
to follow. This is what we may ask of all the various schemes and
agencies&mdash;all the various inquiries after truth now at work in all
the different branches and classes of Christendom&mdash;“Ride out
amongst those quicksands! Ride out in the most
<span class = "pagenum">292</span>
<a name = "page292" id = "page292"> </a>
opposite directions, and let him that first finds solid ground call out
to us! It may perchance be the very ground in the midst of this quaking
morass where we shall be able to stand firm and move the world.”</p>

<p>There is one special variety of means which I would venture to name
in conclusion. Ever since the close of the Apostolic age there have been
two separate agencies in the Christian Church by which the work of
conversion has been carried on. The chief, the recognized, the ordinary
agency has been that of the clergy. Every presbyter, every bishop in the
Church of the first ages, and again in the beginning of Christian
Europe, was, in the strict sense of the word, a&nbsp;missionary; and
although their functions have in these latter days been for the most
part best fulfilled by following their stationary, fixed, pastoral
charges, yet it is still from their ranks in all the different churches
that the noble army of missionaries and martyrs in foreign lands has
been, and is and must be recruited. Most unwise and unworthy would be
any word which should underrate the importance of this mighty element in
the work of renewing the face of the earth. But there has always been
recognized, more or less distinctly, the agency of Christian laymen in
this same work of evangelization. Not only in that more general sense in
which I have already indicated the effect of the laws, and literature,
and influence of Christian Europe&mdash;not only in that unquestionable
sense in which the best of all missionaries is a high-minded governor,
or an upright magistrate, or a devout and pure-minded soldier, who is
always “trusting in God and doing his duty;” not only in these senses do
we look for the coöperation of laymen, but also in the more direct forms
of instruction,
<span class = "pagenum">293</span>
<a name = "page293" id = "page293"> </a>
of intelligent and far-seeing interest in labors, which, though carried
on mainly by the clergy, must, if they are to be good for anything,
concern all mankind alike. In the early centuries of Christianity the
aid of laymen was freely invoked and freely given in this great cause.
Such was Origen, the most learned and the most gifted of the Fathers,
who preached as a layman in the presence of presbyters and bishops. Such
was one of the first evangelizers of India, Pantænus; such was the
hermit Telemachus, whose earnest protest, aided by his heroic death,
extinguished at Rome the horrors of the gladiatorial games; such was
Antony, the mighty preacher in the wilds of the Thebaid and the streets
of Alexandria; such, in later days, was Francis of Assisi, when first he
began his career as the most famous preacher of the Middle Ages; such,
just before the Reformation, was our own Sir Thomas More.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagV_29" id = "tagV_29" href = "#noteV_29">29</a> In these
instances, as in many others, the influence, the learning, the zeal of
laymen, was directly imported into the work of Christianizing the
nations of Europe. It is for this reason that we in our age also, so far
as the law and order of our churches permit, have frequently received
the assistance of laymen; who, by the weight of their character or their
knowledge, can render a fresh testimony, or throw a fresh light on
subjects where we, the clergy, should perhaps be heard less willingly.
As their voices have been raised on this sacred subject of missions in
many a humble parish church; as also on other sacred topics, such as
Christian art and
<span class = "pagenum">294</span>
<a name = "page294" id = "page294"> </a>
history, their words have often been heard within the consecrated walls
of this and other great abbeys and cathedrals;&mdash;so, in the hope
that a more systematic form may thus be given to our knowledge, and a
more concentrated direction to our zeal, we shall have the privilege of
listening this evening in the nave of this church to a scholar renowned
throughout the world, whose knowledge of all heathen religions, ancient
and modern, in their relation to the experience of Christian missions,
probably exceeds that of any other single person in Europe.</p>

<p>I conclude by once more applying the Apostle’s words to the Means and
the End of Christian missions. We would to God that whether by little or
by much, whether by sudden stroke or by elaborate reasoning, whether in
a brief moment or by long process of years, whether by the fervor of
active clergy, or by the learning of impartial laymen, whether by
illiterate simplicity or by wide philosophy&mdash;not only those who
hear me, but all on whom the services of this day, far and near, have
any influence, may become, at least in some degree, such as was Paul the
Apostle, such as have been the wisest and best of Christian
missionaries, except only those bonds which belong to time and place,
not to the Eternal Spirit and the Everlasting Gospel of Jesus Christ. We
cannot wish a better wish, or pray a better prayer to God on this day
than that amongst the missionaries who teach, amongst the heathens who
hear, there should be raised up men who should exhibit that type of
Christian truth and of Christian life which was seen by Festus and
Agrippa in Paul of Tarsus. May the Giver of all good gifts give to us
some portion of his cheerful and manly faith, of
<span class = "pagenum">295</span>
<a name = "page295" id = "page295"> </a>
his fearless energy, of his horror of narrowness and superstition, of
his love for God and for mankind, of his absolute faith in the triumph
of his Redeemer’s cause. May God our Father waken in us the sense that
we are all his children; may the whole earth become more and more one
fold under one Good Shepherd, Jesus Christ his Son; may the Holy Spirit
of Heaven</p>

ON THE VITALITY OF BRAHMANISM.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> delivery of a lecture on
Missions in Westminster Abbey by a layman, and that layman a German,
caused great excitement at the time. While some persons of great
experience and authority in Church and State expressed their full
approval of the bold step which the Dean of Westminister had taken, and
while some of the most devoted missionaries conveyed to me their hearty
thanks for what I had said in my lecture, others could not find terms
sufficiently violent to vent their displeasure against the Dean, and to
proclaim their horror at the heretical opinions embodied in my address.
I&nbsp;was publicly threatened with legal proceedings, and an eminent
lawyer informed me in the “Times” of the exact length of imprisonment I
should have to undergo.</p>

<p>I did not reply. I had lived long enough in England to know that no
good cause can ever be served by a breach of the law, and neither the
Dean nor I myself would have acted as we did unless it had been
ascertained beforehand from the highest authorities that, with the
sanction of the Dean, there was nothing illegal in a layman delivering
such a lecture within the precincts of his Abbey. As to the opinions
which I expressed on that occasion, I&nbsp;had expressed them before in
my published “Lectures on the Science of Religion.” Whether they are
orthodox or heretical, others are more competent to determine
<span class = "pagenum">297</span>
<a name = "page297" id = "page297"> </a>
than I am. I&nbsp;simply hold them to be true, and at my time of life,
mere contradictions, abuse, or even threats are not likely to keep me
from expressing opinions which, whether rightly or wrongly, seem to me
founded in truth.</p>

<p>But while I refrained from replying to mere outbursts of anger,
I&nbsp;gladly availed myself of the opportunity offered by an article
published in the “Fortnightly Review” (July, 1874), by Mr. Lyall,
a&nbsp;highly distinguished Indian civilian, in order to explain more
fully some of the views expressed in my lecture which seemed liable to
misapprehension. Unfortunately the writer of the article “On Missionary
Religions” had not the whole of my lecture before him when writing his
criticisms, but had to form his opinion of it from a condensed report
which appeared in the “Times” of December 5th, 1873. The limits of a
lecture are in themselves very narrow, and when so large a subject as
that of which I had to treat in Westminster Abbey had to be condensed
within sixty minutes, not only those who wish to misunderstand, but
those also who try to judge fairly, may discover in what has been said,
or what has not been said, a&nbsp;very different meaning from that which
the lecturer wished to convey. And if a closely-packed lecture is
compressed once more into one column of the “Times,” it is hardly
possible to avoid what has happened in this case. Mr. Lyall has blamed
me for not quoting facts or statements which, as he will have seen by
this time, I&nbsp;had quoted in my lecture. I&nbsp;am reminded by him,
for instance, of the remarks made by Sir George Campbell in his report
upon the government of Bengal in 1871&ndash;72, when he wrote, “It is a
great mistake to
<span class = "pagenum">298</span>
<a name = "page298" id = "page298"> </a>
suppose that the Hindu religion is not proselytizing; the system of
castes gives room for the introduction of any number of outsiders; so
long as people do not interfere with existing castes, they may form a
new caste and call themselves Hindus; and the Brahmans are always ready
to receive all who will submit to them and pay them. The process of
manufacturing Rajputs from ambitious aborigines goes on before our
eyes.” “This,” Mr. Lyall observes, “is one recently recorded observation
out of many that might be quoted.”</p>

<p>It is this very passage which I had quoted in my third note, only
that in quoting it from the “Report on the Progress and Condition of
India,” laid before Parliament in 1873, I&nbsp;had added the caution of
the reporter, that “this assertion must be taken with reserve.”</p>

<p>With such small exceptions, however, I have really nothing to
complain of in the line of argument adopted by Mr. Lyall. I&nbsp;believe
that, after having read my paper, he would have modified some portions
of what he has written, but I feel equally certain that it is well that
what he has written should have been written, and should be carefully
pondered both by those who have the interests of the natives, and by
those who have the interests of Christian missions at heart. The few
remarks which I take the liberty of making are made by way of
explanation only; on all truly essential points I believe there is not
much difference of opinion between Mr. Lyall and myself.</p>

<p>As my lecture in Westminister Abbey was delivered shortly after the
publication of my “Introduction to the Science of Religion,”
I&nbsp;ventured to take
<span class = "pagenum">299</span>
<a name = "page299" id = "page299"> </a>
certain points which I had fully treated there as generally known. One
of them is the exact value to be ascribed to canonical books in a
scientific treatment of religion. When Mr. Lyall observes <i>in
limine</i>, that inferences as to the nature and tendency of various
existing religions which are drawn from study and exegetic comparison of
their scriptures, must be qualified by actual observation of these
religions and their popular form and working effects, he expresses an
opinion which I hold as strongly as he holds it himself. After
enumerating the books which are recognized as sacred or authoritative by
large religious communities in India, books of such bulk and such
difficulty that it seems almost impossible for any single scholar to
master them in their entirety, I&nbsp;added (p.&nbsp;111), “And even
then our eyes would not have reached many of the sacred recesses in
which the Hindu mind has taken refuge, either to meditate on the great
problems of life, or to free itself from the temptations and fetters of
worldly existence by penances and mortifications of the most exquisite
cruelty. India has always been teeming with religious sects, and its
religious life has been broken up into countless local centres which it
required all the ingenuity and perseverance of a priestly caste to hold
together with a semblance of dogmatic uniformity.”</p>

<p>We must take care, however, in all scientific studies, not to render
a task impossible by attaching to it conditions which, humanly speaking,
cannot be fulfilled. It is desirable, no doubt, to study some of the
local varieties of faith and worship in every religion, but it is
impossible to do this with anything like completeness. Were we to wait
till we had examined every Christian sect before trusting ourselves
<span class = "pagenum">300</span>
<a name = "page300" id = "page300"> </a>
to form a general judgment of Christianity, not one of us could honestly
say that he knew his own religion. It seems to me that in studying
religions we must expect to meet with the same difficulties which we
have to encounter in the comparative study of languages. It may, no
doubt, be argued with great force that no one knows English who is
ignorant of the spoken dialects, of the jargon of sailors and miners, or
of the slang of public-houses and prisons. It is perfectly true that
what we call the literary and classical language is never the really
living language of a people, and that a foreigner may know Shakespeare,
Milton, and Byron, and yet fail to understand, if not the debates in
Parliament, at all events the wrangling of sellers and buyers in the
markets of the city. Nevertheless, when we learn English, or German, or
French, or any of the dead languages, such as Latin and Greek, we must
depend on grammars, which grammars are founded on a few classical
writers; and when we speak of these languages in general, when we
subject them to a scientific treatment, analyze them, and attempt to
classify them, we avail ourselves for all such purposes almost
exclusively of classical works, of literary productions of recognized
authority. It is the same, and it can hardly be otherwise, when we
approach the study of religions, whether for practical or for scientific
purposes. Suppose a Hindu wished to know what the Christian religion
really was, should we tell him to go first to Rome, then to Paris, then
to St. Petersburg, then to Athens, then to Oxford, then to Berlin, that
he might hear the sermons of Roman Catholics, Greeks, and Protestants,
or read their so-called religious papers, in order to form out of these
scattered
<span class = "pagenum">301</span>
<a name = "page301" id = "page301"> </a>
impressions an idea of the real nature of the working effects of
Christianity? Or should we not rather tell him to take the Bible, and
the hymns of Christian Churches, and from them to form his ideal of true
Christianity? A&nbsp;religion is much more likely to become
“a&nbsp;mysterious thing,” when it is sought for in the heart of each
individual believer, where alone, no doubt, it truly lives, or in the
endless shibboleths of parties, or in the often contradictory tenets of
sects, than when it is studied in those sacred books which are
recognized as authoritative by all believers, however much they may vary
in their interpretations of certain passages, and still more in the
practical application of the doctrines contained in their sacred codes
to the ordering of their daily life. Let the dialects of languages or
religions be studied by all means, let even the peculiarities in the
utterances of each town, village, or family, be carefully noted; but let
it be recognized at the same time that, for practical purposes, the
immense variety of individual expression has to be merged in one general
type, and that this alone supplies the chance of a truly scientific
treatment.</p>

<p>So much in justification of the principle which I have followed
throughout in my treatment of the so-called Book-religions, holding that
they must be judged, first of all, out of their own mouths, <i>i.e.</i>,
out of their sacred writings. Although each individual believer is
responsible for his religion, no religion can be made responsible for
each individual believer. Even if we adopt the theory of development in
religion, and grant to every thinking man his right of private
interpretation, there remains, and their must always remain, to the
historian of religion, an
<span class = "pagenum">302</span>
<a name = "page302" id = "page302"> </a>
appeal to the statutes of the original code with which each religion
stands and falls, and by which alone it can justly be judged.</p>

<p>It may be, as Mr. Lyall says, an inveterate modern habit to assume
all great historic names to represent something definite, symmetrical,
and organized. It may be that Asiatic institutions, as he asserts, are
incapable of being circumscribed by rules and formal definitions. But
Mr. Lyall, if he directed his attention to European institutions, would
meet with much the same difficulties there. Christianity, in the largest
sense of the word, is as difficult to define as Brahmanism, the English
constitution is as unsymmetrical as the system of caste. Yet, if we mean
to speak and argue about them, we must attempt to define them, and with
regard to any religion, whether Asiatic or European, no definition, it
seems to me, can be fairer than that which we gain from its canonical
books.</p>

<p>I now come to a more important point. I had divided the six great
religions of the world into <i>Missionary</i> and <i>non-Missionary</i>,
including Judaism, Brahmanism, and Zoroastrianism, under the latter;
Buddhism, Christianity, and Mohammedanism, under the former category. If
I had followed the good old rule of always giving a definition of
technical terms, the objections raised by Mr. Lyall and others would
probably never have been urged. I&nbsp;thought, however, that from the
whole tenor of my lecture it would have been clear that by missionary
religions I meant <i>those in which the spreading of the truth and the
conversion of unbelievers are raised to the rank of a sacred duty by the
founder or his immediate successors</i>. In explaining the meaning of
the word proselyte, or
<span class = "pagenum">303</span>
<a name = "page303" id = "page303"> </a>
<span class = "greek" title = "prosêlutos">προσήλυτος</span>, I&nbsp;had
shown that literally it means those who come to us, not those to whom we
go, so that even a religion so exclusive as Judaism might admit
proselytes, might possibly, if we insisted only on the etymological
meaning of the word, be called proselytizing, without having any right
to the name of a missionary religion. But I imagined that I had said
enough to make such a misunderstanding impossible. We may say that the
English nobility grows, but we should never say that it proselytizes,
and it would be a mere playing with words if, because Brahmanism admits
new-comers, we were to claim for it the title of a proselytizing
religion. The Brahmanic Scriptures have not a word of welcome for
converts, quite the contrary; and as long as these Scriptures are
recognized as the highest authority by the Hindus themselves, we have no
right to ascribe to Brahmanism what is in direct contradiction with
their teaching. The burning of widows was not enjoined in the Vedas, and
hence, in order to gain a sanction for it, a&nbsp;passage in the Veda
was falsified. No such necessity was ever felt with regard to gaining
converts for the Brahmanic faith, and this shows that, though admission
to certain Brahmanic privileges may be easier at present than it was in
the days of Viśvâmitra, conversion by persuasion has never become an
integral portion of the Brahmanic law<ins class = "correction" title =
"text has , for .">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>However, as Mr. Lyall does not stand alone in his opinions, and as
others have claimed for Judaism and Zoroastrianism the same missionary
character which he claims in the name of Brahmanism, a&nbsp;few
explanations may not be out of place.</p>

<p>Till very lately, an orthodox Jew was rather proud of the fact that
he and his people had never condescended
<span class = "pagenum">304</span>
<a name = "page304" id = "page304"> </a>
to spread their religion among Christians by such means as Christians
use for the conversion of Jews. The Parsi community, too, seemed to
share with the Quakers a prudent reluctance in admitting outsiders to
the advantages conferred by membership of so respectable and influential
a community, while the Brahmans certainly were the very last to compass
heaven and earth for the conversion of Mlecchas or outcasts. Suddenly,
however, all this is changed. The Chief Rabbi in London, stung to the
quick by the reproach of the absence of the missionary spirit in
Judaism, has delivered a sermon to show that I had maligned his people,
and that, though they never had missionaries, they had been the most
proselytizing people in the world. Some strong arguments in support of
the same view have been brought forward by the Rev. Charles Voysey,
whose conception of Judaism, however, is founded rather on what the
great prophets wished it should have been than on what history teaches
us it was. As the facts and arguments advanced by the Jewish advocates
did not modify my judgment of the historical character of Judaism,
I&nbsp;did not think it necessary to reply, particularly as another
eminent Rabbi, the editor of the “Jewish World,” fully endorsed my views
of Judaism, and expressed his surprise at the unorthodox theories
advanced by so high an authority as Dr. Adler. I&nbsp;am informed,
however, that the discussion thus originated will not remain without
practical results, and that something like a Jewish Missionary Society
is actually forming in London, to prove that, if missionary zeal is a
test of life, the Jewish religion will not shrink from such a test. “We
have done something,” the Rev. Charles Voysey remarks, “to
<span class = "pagenum">305</span>
<a name = "page305" id = "page305"> </a>
stir them up; but let us not forget that our reminder was answered, not
by a repulse or expression of surprise, but by an assurance that many
earnest Jews had already been thinking of this very work, and planning
among themselves how they could revive some kind of missionary
enterprise. Before long, I&nbsp;feel sure they will give practical
evidence that the missionary spirit is still alive and striving in their
religion.” And again: “The Jews will soon show whether their religion is
alive or dead, will soon meet the rival religions of the world on more
than equal terms, and will once more take the lead in these days of
enlightened belief, and in search after conceptions worthy of a God,
just as of old Judaism stood on a lofty height, far above all the
religions of mankind.”</p>

<p>What has happened in London seems to have happened in Bombay also.
The Zoroastrians, too, did not like to be told that their religion was
dying, and that their gradual decay was due to the absence of the
missionary spirit among them. We read in the “Oriental” of April, 1874,
“There is a discussion as to whether it is contrary to the creed of
Zoroaster to seek converts to the faith. While conceding that Zoroaster
was himself opposed to proselytizing heathens, most of the Parsis hold
that the great decrease in the number of his followers renders it
absolutely necessary to attempt to augment the sect.”</p>

<p>Lastly, Mr. Lyall stands up for Brahmanism, and maintains that in
India Brahmanism had spread out during the last hundred years, while
Islam and Christianity have contracted. “More persons in India,” he
says, “become every year Brahmanists, than all the converts to all the
other religions in India, put together.” “The number of converts,” he
maintains,
<span class = "pagenum">306</span>
<a name = "page306" id = "page306"> </a>
“added to Brahmanism in the last few generations, especially in this
country, must be immense; and <i>if the word proselyte may be used in
the sense of one that has come, not necessarily being one that has been
invited or persuaded to come</i>, then Brahmanism may lay claim to be by
far the most successful proselytizing religion of modern times in
India.”</p>

<p>The words which I have ventured to put in italics, will show at once
how little difference of opinion there is between Mr. Lyall and myself,
as long as we use the same words in the same sense. If proselytizing
could be used in the etymological sense, here assigned to it by Mr.
Lyall, then, no doubt, Brahmanism would be a proselytizing or missionary
religion. But this is mere playing with words. In English, proselytizing
is never used in that sense. If I meant by missionary religions nothing
more than religions which are capable of increase by admitting those
that wish to be admitted, religions which say to the world at large,
“Knock and it shall be opened unto you,” but no more, then, no doubt,
Brahmanism, or at least some phases of it, might be called by that name.
But what, according to my explanation, constitutes a missionary religion
is something totally different. It is the spirit of truth in the hearts
of believers which cannot rest unless it manifests itself in thought,
word, and deed, which is not satisfied till it has carried its message
to every human soul, till what it believes to be the truth is accepted
as the truth by all members of the human family.</p>

<p>That spirit imparts to certain religions a character of their own,
a&nbsp;character which, if I am not mistaken, constitutes the vital
principle of our own religion, and of the other two which, in that
respect, stand
<span class = "pagenum">307</span>
<a name = "page307" id = "page307"> </a>
nearest to Christianity&mdash;Buddhism and Mohammedanism. This is not a
mere outward difference, depending on the willingness of others to join
or not to join; it is an inward difference which stamped Christianity as
a missionary religion, when as yet it counted no more than twelve
apostles, and which lays on every one that calls himself a Christian the
duty of avowing his convictions, whatever they may be, and gaining
others to embrace the truth. In that sense every true Christian is a
missionary. Mr. Lyall is evidently aware of all this, if we may judge by
the expressions which he uses when speaking of the increase of
Brahmanism. He speaks of the clans and races which inhabit the
hill-tracts, the out-lying uplands, and the uncleared jungle districts
of India, as <i>melting</i> into Hinduism. He represents the ethnical
frontier, described by Mr. Hunter in the “Annals of Rural Bengal,” as an
ever-breaking shore of primitive beliefs, which <i>tumble</i> constantly
into the ocean of Brahmanism. And even when he dwells on the fact that
non-Aryans are invited by the Brahmans to enter in, he adds that this is
done for the sake of profit and repute, not from a wish to eradicate
error, to save souls, or to spread the truth. Such instances occurred
even in the ancient history of India; and I had myself, in my “History
of Ancient Sanskrit Literature,” pointed out the case of the Rathakaras
or carpenters who were admitted to the Vedic sacrifices, and who,
probably from a mere similarity of name&mdash;their leader being called
Bribu,&mdash;had the old Vedic Ribhus assigned to them as their peculiar
deities. But these were exceptions, they were <i>concessions aux
nègres</i>, deviations from traditional rules, entirely owing to the
pressure of circumstances; not
<span class = "pagenum">308</span>
<a name = "page308" id = "page308"> </a>
manifestations springing from religious impulses. If Mr. Lyall remarks
himself, that a religion which thus, half involuntarily, enlarges its
borders, is not, in the strict sense of the word, a&nbsp;missionary
religion, he shows that he is fully aware of the profound difference
between a religion that grows by mere agglomeration and a religion that
grows by its own strength, by its irrepressible missionary zeal. In
answer to his concluding remark, that this ground was <i>not</i> taken
in my lecture, I&nbsp;can only say that it was, nay, that it formed the
very foundation on which the whole argument of my lecture was meant to
rest.</p>

<p>There is more force in the objections which Mr. Lyall raises against
my calling Brahmanism already dead. The word was too strong; at all
events, it was liable to be misunderstood. What I meant to say was that
the popular worship of Śiva and <span class = "sanskrit">Vishṇu</span>
belongs to the same intellectual stratum as the worship of Jupiter and
Apollo, that it is an anachronism in the nineteenth century, and that,
for our purposes, for prognosticating the issues of the religious
struggles of the future, it may simply be set aside. For settling any of
the questions that may be said to be pending between Christianity,
Mohammedanism, and Buddhism, Brahmanism is dead. For converting any
number of Christians, Mohammedans, and Buddhists back to <ins class =
"correction" title = "printed as shown">idolworship</ins>, Brahmanism is
dead. It may absorb Sonthals, and Gonds, and Bhils, and other half
savage races, with their rough-hewn jungle deities, it may even raise
them to a higher stage of civilization, and imbue them with the first
principles of a truer faith and a purer worship, but for carrying any of
the strong positions of Buddhism, Mohammedanism, and Christianity,
Brahmanism is powerless
<span class = "pagenum">309</span>
<a name = "page309" id = "page309"> </a>
and dead. In India itself, where it clings to the soil with a thousand
roots, it was beaten by Buddhism, and, if it afterwards recovered its
position, that was due to physical force, not to persuasion and
conversion. The struggle between Mohammedanism and Brahmanism in India
was on both sides a political rather than a religious struggle: still
when a change of religion arose from conviction, we see Brahmanism
yielding to the purer light of Islam, not Islam to Brahmanism.</p>

<p>I did not undervalue the actual power of Brahmanism, particularly its
power of resistance; nor did I prophesy its speedy extinction.
I&nbsp;said on the contrary that “a&nbsp;religion may linger on for a
long time, and be accepted by the large masses of the people, because it
is there, and there is nothing better.” “It is true,” I&nbsp;added,
“there are millions of children, women, and men in India who fall down
before the stone image of <span class = "sanskrit">Vishṇu</span>, with
his four arms, riding on a creature, half-bird, half-man, or sleeping on
the serpent; who worship Śiva, a&nbsp;monster with three eyes, riding
naked on a bull, with a necklace of skulls for his ornament. There are
human beings who still believe in a god of war, Kârtikeya, with six
faces, riding on a peacock, and holding bow and arrow in his hands; and
who invoke a god of success, <span class = "sanskrit">Gaṇeśa</span>,
with four hands and an elephant’s head, sitting on a rat. Nay, it is
true that, in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century, the figure
of the goddess Kali is carried through the streets of her own city,
Calcutta, her wild disheveled hair reaching to her feet, with a necklace
of human heads, her tongue protruded from her mouth, her girdle stained
with blood. All this is true; but ask any Hindu who can read
<span class = "pagenum">310</span>
<a name = "page310" id = "page310"> </a>
and write and think, whether these are the gods he believes in, and he
will smile at your credulity. How long this living death of national
religion in India may last, no one can tell: for our purposes, however,
for gaining an idea of the issue of the great religious struggle of the
future, that religion is dead and gone.”</p>

<p>I ask Mr. Lyall, is this true or is it not? He says himself, “that
Brahmanism may possibly melt away of a heap and break up, I&nbsp;would
not absolutely deny.” Would Mr. Lyall say the same of Buddhism,
Mohammedanism, or Christianity? He points himself to the description
which Gibbon gives of the ancient Roman religion in the second century
of the Christian era, and shows how closely applicable it is to the
present state of Brahmanism in India. “The tolerant superstition of the
people, ‘not confined by the claims of any speculative system,’ the
‘devout polytheist, whom fear, gratitude, and curiosity, a&nbsp;dream,
or an omen, a&nbsp;singular disorder, or a distant journey, perpetually
disposed to multiply the articles of his belief, and to enlarge the list
of his protectors;’ the ‘ingenious youth alike instructed in every
school to reject and despise the religion of the multitude;’ the
philosophic class who ‘look with indulgence on the errors of the vulgar,
diligently practice the ceremonies of their fathers, and devoutly
frequent the temples of their gods;’ the ‘magistrates who know and value
the advantages of religion as it is connected with civil
government;’&mdash;all these scenes and feelings are represented in
India at this moment, though by no means in all parts of India.” If,
then, in the second century a student of religious pathology had
expressed his conviction that in spite of the number of its professors,
in spite of its antiquity, in spite of its
<span class = "pagenum">311</span>
<a name = "page311" id = "page311"> </a>
indigenous character, in spite of its political, civil, and social
influences, in spite of its temples and priests, in spite of its schools
and philosophers, the ancient religion of Jupiter had lost its vitality,
was sick unto death, nay, for all real purposes was dead, would he have
been far wrong? It may be replied, no doubt, that similar corruptions
have crept into other religions also, that gaudy dolls are carried about
in Christian cathedrals, that people are invited to see tears rolling
down from the eyes of images, or to worship wine changed into blood, to
say nothing of even more terrible hallucinations on the Eucharist
propounded from so-called Protestant pulpits, and that, in spite of all
this, we should not call the Christian religion dying or dead. This is
true, and I thought that by my remarks on the different revivals of
Hinduism from the twelfth to the nineteenth century, I&nbsp;had
sufficiently indicated that new life may spring even from such
apparently hopeless corruption. If it is Brahmanism that lives in the
sects of Râmânuja and Râmânanda, in the poetry of Kabir and the wisdom
of Nànak, in the honest purposes of Ram Mohun Roy and in the high
aspirations of Keshub Chunder Sen, then I quite agree with Mr. Lyall
that Brahmanism is not dead, but lives more intensely than ever.</p>

<p>But here, for some reason or other, Mr. Lyall seems to demur to my
hopeful estimate of Brahmoism. He had expressed his own conviction that
Brahmanism, though it might suddenly collapse and vanish, was more
likely gradually to spiritualize and centralize its Pantheon, reduce its
theology to a compact system, soften down its morals by symbolisms and
interportations, discard<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘ for “"> “</ins>dogmatic extremes,” and generally
<span class = "pagenum">312</span>
<a name = "page312" id = "page312"> </a>
to bring itself into accordance with improved standards of science and
intelligence. He had also quoted with implied approval the remark of
qualified observers, “that we might at any time witness a great
Brahmanic reforming revival in India, if some really gifted and
singularly powerful prophet were to arise among the Hindus.” But when I
hinted that this prophet had actually arisen, and that in Brahmoism, as
preached by Ram Mohun Roy, Debendranath Tagore, and Keshub Chunder Sen,
we ought to recognize a transition from Brahmanism to a purer faith;
when I pointed out that, though Christian missionaries might not wish to
recognize Brahmoism as their work, it was the work of those missionary
Christians who have lived in India as examples of a true Christian life,
who have approached the natives in a truly missionary spirit, in the
spirit of truth and in the spirit of love, Mr. Lyall replies that
“Brahmoism, as propagated by Keshub Chunder Sen, seems to be
Unitarianism of an European type, and, so far as one can understand its
argument, appears to have no logical stability or <i>locus standi</i>
between revelation and pure rationalism; that it propounds either too
much or too little to its hearers.” “A&nbsp;faith,” he continues, “which
contains mere fervent sentiments, and high conceptions of morality, does
not partake of the complexion or nature of those religions which have
encompassed the heart of great nations, nor is it generally supposed in
India that Brahmoism is perceptibly on the increase.”</p>

<p><i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, this is very much what an orthodox Rabbi
might have said of Christianity. Let us wait. I&nbsp;am not given to
prophecy, but though I am no longer young, I&nbsp;still hold to a belief
that a
<span class = "pagenum">313</span>
<a name = "page313" id = "page313"> </a>
cause upheld with such honesty of purpose, purity, and unselfishness as
Brahmoism has been, must and will meet with ultimate success. Does Mr.
Lyall think that Unitarian Christianity is no Christianity? Does he find
logical stability in Trinitarianism? Does he consider pure rationalism
incompatible with revelation? Does he know of any teacher who might not
be accused of saying either too little or too much? In <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 890 the Double Procession was as much a burning
question as the Homoousia in 324,&mdash;are, therefore, both Channing
and Dr. Döllinger to be anathematized now? Brahmoism may not be like the
religions of old, but must the religions of the future be like the
religions of the past? However, I&nbsp;do not wish to draw Mr. Lyall
into a theological argument. His estimate of the real value and vitality
of Brahmoism may be right, mine may be wrong. His presence in India, and
his personal intercourse with the Brahmos, may have given him
opportunities of judging which I have not. Only let us not forget that
for watching the movements of a great struggle, and for judging of its
successful issue, a&nbsp;certain distance from the field of battle has
its advantages, and that judges in India have not always proved the best
judges of India.</p>

<p>One point, however, I am quite willing to concede. If Brahmoism and
similar movements may be considered as reforms and resuscitations of
Brahmanism, then I withdraw my expression that Brahmanism is dead. Only
let us remember that we are thus using Brahmanism in two very different
senses, that we are again playing with words. In the one sense it is
stark idolatry, in the other the loftiest spiritual worship. The former
asserts the existence of many personal
<span class = "pagenum">314</span>
<a name = "page314" id = "page314"> </a>
gods, the latter shrinks even from the attribute of personality as too
human a conception of the Highest Spirit. The former makes the priest a
kind of god on earth, the latter proclaims the priesthood of all men;
the former is guided by scriptures which man calls sacred, the latter
knows of no sacred oracles but the still small voice in the heart of
every man. The two are like two opposite poles. What is negative on one
side is positive on the other; what is regarded by the one as the most
sacred truth is anathematized by the other as deadly error.</p>

<p>Mr. Lyall tells us of Ghási Dás, an inspired prophet, who sojourned
in the wilderness for six months, and then issued forth preaching to the
poor and ignorant the creed of the True Name (Satnám). He gathered about
half a million people together before he died in 1850. He borrowed his
doctrines from the well-known Hindu sect of the Satnâmis, and though he
denounced Brahmanic abuses, he instituted caste rules of his own, and
his successor was murdered, not for heresy, but because he aped
Brahmanic insignia and privileges. Mr. Lyall thinks that this community,
if left alone, will relapse into a modified Brahmanism. This may be so,
but it can hardly be said, that a reform, the followers of which are
murdered for aping Brahmanic insignia and privileges, represents
Brahmanism which Mr. Lyall defines as “the broad denomination of what is
recognized by all Hindus as the supreme theological faculty and the
comprehensive scheme of authoritative tradition to which all minor
beliefs are referred for sanction<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ’ for ”">.”</ins></p>

<p>When I spoke of Brahmanism as dead, I meant the popular orthodox
Brahmanism, which is openly patronized by the Brahmans, though scorned
by them in
<span class = "pagenum">315</span>
<a name = "page315" id = "page315"> </a>
secret; I&nbsp;did not, and could not, mean the worship of Bramah as the
Supreme Spirit, which has existed in India from the time of the
Upanishads to the present day, and has lately assumed the name of
Brahmoism,&mdash;a worship so pure, so exalted, so deeply human, so
truly divine, that every man can join in it without apostasy, whether he
be born a Jew, a&nbsp;Gentile, or a Christian.</p>

<p>That many antagonistic forms of religious faith, some the most
degraded, others the most exalted, should live on the same soil, among
the same people, is indeed a disheartening truth, enough almost to shake
one’s belief in the common origin and the common destinies of the human
race. And yet we must not shut our eyes to the fact that amongst
ourselves, too, men who call themselves Christians are almost as widely
separated from each other in their conceptions of the Divine and the
Human, in their grounds of belief and in their sense of duty, as, in
India, the worshippers of <span class = "sanskrit">Gaṇeśa</span>, the
god of success, with four hands and an elephant’s head, sitting on a
rat, on one side, and the believers in the true Brahma on the other.
There is a Christianity that is dead, though it may be professed by
millions of people, but there is also, let us trust, a&nbsp;Christianity
that is alive, though it may count but twelve apostles. As in India, so
in Europe, many would call death what we call life, many would call life
what we call death. Here, as elsewhere, it is high time that men should
define the exact meaning of their words, trusting that definiteness,
frankness, and honesty may offer a better chance of mutual
understanding, and serve as a stronger bond of union between man and
man, than vague formulas, faint-hearted reticence, and what is at the
root of it
<span class = "pagenum">316</span>
<a name = "page316" id = "page316"> </a>
all, want of true love of Man, and of true faith in God.</p>

<p>If Mr. Lyall imagined that the object of my Lecture was to discourage
missionary efforts, he must have found out his mistake, when he came to
read it, as I delivered it in Westminster Abbey. I&nbsp;know of no
nobler life than that of a true missionary. I&nbsp;tried to defend the
labors of the paternal missionary against disparaging criticisms.
I&nbsp;tried to account for the small success of controversial missions,
by showing how little is gained by mere argument and casuistry at home.
And I pointed to the indirect missionary influence, exercised by every
man who leads a Christian life in India or elsewhere, as the most
encouraging sign of the final triumph of a pure and living Christianity.
It is very possible, as Mr. Lyall says somewhat sarcastically, that
“missionaries will even yet hardly agree that the essentials of their
religion are not in the creeds, but in love; because they are sent forth
to propound scriptures which say clearly that what we believe or
disbelieve is literally a <i>burning</i> question.” But those who, with
Mr. Lyall, consider love of man founded on love of God, nothing but
“flat morality,” must have forgotten that a Higher One than they
declared, that on these two hang all the law and the commandments. By
placing abstruse tenets, the handiwork of Popes and Councils, in the
place of Christ’s teaching, and by making a belief in these positive
articles a <i>burning</i> question, weak mortals have driven weak
mortals to ask, “Are we Christians still?” Let them for once “by
observation and experience” try the oldest and simplest and most
positive article of Christianity, real love of man founded on real love
of God, and I believe they will soon ask themselves, “When shall we be
Christians at last?”</p>

The <i>Indian Mirror</i> (Sept. 10, 1869) constantly treats of
missionary efforts of various kinds in a spirit which is not only
friendly, but even desirous of reciprocal sympathy; and hopeful that
whatever differences may exist between them (the missionaries) and the
Brahmos, the two parties will heartily combine as brethren to
exterminate idolatry, and promote true morality in India.</p>

“The large body of European and American missionaries settled in India
bring their various moral influences to bear upon the country with the
greater force, because they act together with a compactness which is but
little understood. Though belonging to various denominations of
Christians, yet from the nature of their work, their isolated position,
and their long experience, they have been led to think rather of the
numerous questions on which they agree, than of those on which they
differ, and they coöperate heartily together<ins class = "correction"

friendly arrangements, and, with a few exceptions, it is a fixed rule
among them that they will not interfere with each other’s converts and
each other’s spheres of duty. School books, translations of the
Scriptures and religious works, prepared by various missions, are used
in common; and help and improvements secured by one mission are freely
placed at the command of all. The large body of missionaries resident in
each of the presidency towns form missionary conferences, hold periodic
meetings, and act together on public matters. They have frequently
addressed the Indian government on important social questions involving
the welfare of the native community, and have suggested valuable
improvements in existing laws. During the past twenty years, on five
occasions, general conferences have been held for mutual consultation
respecting their missionary work; and in January last, at the latest of
these gatherings, at Allahabad, 121 missionaries met together, belonging
to twenty different societies, and including several men of long
experience who have been twenty years in India.” <i>India, Progress and

OPENING ADDRESS.</h3>

<h6>DELIVERED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE ARYAN SECTION<br>
AT THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ORIENTALISTS,<br>
HELD IN LONDON, SEPTEMBER 14&ndash;21, 1874.</h6>

<p><span class = "firstword">No</span> one likes to be asked, what
business he has to exist, and yet, whatever we do, whether singly or in
concert with others, the first question which the world never fails to
address to us, is <i>Dic cur hic?</i> Why are you here? or to put it
into French, What is your <i>raison d’être</i>? We have had to submit to
this examination even before we existed, and many a time have I been
asked the question, both by friend and foe, What is the good of an
International Congress of Orientalists?</p>

<p>I shall endeavor, as shortly as possible, to answer that question,
and show that our Congress is not a mere fortuitous congeries of barren
atoms or molecules, but that we are at least Leibnizian monads, each
with his own self, and force and will, and each determined, within the
limits of some preëstablished harmony, to help in working out some
common purpose, and to achieve some real and lasting good.</p>

<p>It is generally thought that the chief object of a scientific
Congress is social, and I am not one of those who are incapable of
appreciating the delights and
<span class = "pagenum">318</span>
<a name = "page318" id = "page318"> </a>
benefits of social intercourse with hard-working and honest-thinking
men. Much as I detest what is commonly called society, I&nbsp;willingly
give up glaciers and waterfalls, cathedrals and picture galleries, for
one half hour of real society, of free, frank, fresh, and friendly
intercourse, face to face, and mind to mind, with a great, and noble,
and loving soul, such as was Bunsen; with a man intrepid in his
thoughts, his words, and his deeds, such as was John Stuart Mill; or
with a scholar who, whether he had been quarrying heavy blocks, or
chiseling the most brittle filigree work, poured out all his treasures
before you with the pride and pleasure of a child, such as was Eugéne
Burnouf. A&nbsp;Congress therefore, and particularly an International
Congress, would certainly seem to answer some worthy purpose, were it
only by bringing together fellow workers of all countries and ages, by
changing what were to us merely great names into pleasant companions,
and by satisfying that very right and rational curiosity which we all
feel, after having read a really good book, of seeing what the man looks
like who could achieve such triumphs.</p>

<p>All this is perfectly true; yet, however pleasant to ourselves this
social intercourse may appear, in the eyes of the world at large it will
hardly be considered a sufficient excuse for our existence. In order
therefore to satisfy that outer world that we are really doing
something, we point of course to the papers which are read at our public
meetings, and to the discussions which they elicit. Much as I value that
feature also in a scientific congress, I&nbsp;confess I doubt, and I
know that many share that doubt, whether the same result might not be
obtained with much less trouble. A&nbsp;paper that contains something
really new
<span class = "pagenum">319</span>
<a name = "page319" id = "page319"> </a>
and valuable, the result, it may be, of years of toil and thought,
requires to be read with care in a quiet corner of our own study, before
the expression of our assent or dissent can be of any weight or value.
There is too much hollow praise, and occasionally too much wrangling and
ill-natured abuse at our scientific tournaments, and the world at large,
which is never without a tinge of malice and a vein of quiet humor, has
frequently expressed its concern at the waste of “oil and vinegar” which
is occasioned by the frequent meetings of our British and Foreign
Associations.</p>

<p>What then is the real use of a Congress, such as that which has
brought us together this week from all parts of the world? What is the
real excuse for our existence? Why are we here, and not in our
workshops?</p>

<p>It seems to me that the real and permanent use of these scientific
gatherings is twofold.</p>

<p>(1) They enable us to take stock, to compare notes, to see where we
are, and to find out where we ought to be going.</p>

<p>(2) They give us an opportunity, from time to time, to tell the world
where we are, what we have been doing for the world, and what, in
return, we expect the world to do for us.</p>

<p>The danger of all scientific work at present, not only among Oriental
scholars, but, as far as I can see, everywhere, is the tendency to
extreme specialization. Our age shows in that respect a decided reaction
against the spirit of a former age, which those with gray heads among us
can still remember, an age represented in Germany by such names as
Humboldt, Ritter, Böckh, Johannes, Müller, Bopp, Bunsen, and others; men
who look to us like giants, carrying a
<span class = "pagenum">320</span>
<a name = "page320" id = "page320"> </a>
weight of knowledge far too heavy for the shoulders of such mortals as
now be; aye, men who <i>were</i> giants, but whose chief strength
consisted in this, that they were never entirely absorbed or bewildered
by special researches, but kept their eye steadily on the highest
objects of all human knowledge; who could trace the vast outlines of the
kosmos of nature or the kosmos of the mind with an unwavering hand, and
to whose maps and guide books we must still recur, whenever we are in
danger of losing our way in the mazes of minute research. At the present
moment such works as Humboldt’s “Kosmos,” or Bopp’s “Comparative
Grammar,” or Bunsen’s “Christianity and Mankind,” would be impossible.
No one would dare to write them, for fear of not knowing the exact depth
at which the <i>Protogenes Haeckelii</i> has lately been discovered or
the lengthening of a vowel in the <em class =
"sanskrit">Saṃhitapâṭha</em> of the Rig-Veda. It is quite right that
this should be so, at least, for a time; but all rivers, all brooks, all
rills, are meant to flow into the ocean, and all special knowledge, to
keep it from stagnation, must have an outlet into the general knowledge
of the world. Knowledge for its own sake, as it is sometimes called, is
the most dangerous idol that a student can worship. We despise the miser
who amasses money for the sake of money, but still more contemptible is
the intellectual miser who hoards up knowledge instead of spending it,
though, with regard to most of our knowledge, we may be well assured and
satisfied that, as we brought nothing into the world so we may carry
nothing out.</p>

<p>Against this danger of mistaking the means for the end, of making
bricks without making mortar, of working for ourselves instead of
working for others,
<span class = "pagenum">321</span>
<a name = "page321" id = "page321"> </a>
meetings such as our own, bringing together so large a number of the
first Oriental scholars of Europe, seem to me a most excellent
safeguard. They draw us out of our shell, away from our common routine,
away from that small orbit of thought in which each of us moves day
after day, and make us realize more fully, that there are other stars
moving all around us in our little universe, that we all belong to one
celestial system, or to one terrestrial commonwealth, and that, if we
want to see real progress in that work with which we are more especially
entrusted, the re-conquest of the Eastern world, we must work with one
another, for one another, like members of one body, like soldiers of one
army, guided by common principles, striving after common purposes, and
sustained by common sympathies. Oriental literature is of such enormous
dimensions that our small army of scholars can occupy certain prominent
positions only; but those points, like the stations of a trigonometrical
survey, ought to be carefully chosen, so as to be able to work in
harmony together. I&nbsp;hope that in that respect our Congress may
prove of special benefit. We shall hear, each of us, from others, what
they wish us to do. “Why don’t you finish this?” “Why don’t you publish
that?” are questions which we have already heard asked by many of our
friends. We shall be able to avoid what happens so often, that two men
collect materials for exactly the same work, and we may possibly hear of
some combined effort to carry out great works, which can only be carried
out <i>viribus unitis</i>, and of which I may at least mention one,
a&nbsp;translation of the “Sacred Books of Mankind.” Important progress
has already been made for setting on foot this great undertaking, an
undertaking which
<span class = "pagenum">322</span>
<a name = "page322" id = "page322"> </a>
I think the world has a right to demand from Oriental scholars, but
which can only be carried out by joint action. This Congress has helped
us to lay the foundation-stone, and I trust that at our next Congress we
shall be able to produce some tangible results.</p>

<p>I now come to the second point. A Congress enables us to tell the
world what we have been doing. This, it seems to me, is particularly
needful with regard to Oriental studies which, with the exception of
Hebrew, still stand outside the pale of our schools and universities,
and are cultivated by the very smallest number of students. And yet,
I&nbsp;make bold to say, that during the last hundred, and still more
during the last fifty years, Oriental studies have contributed more than
any other branch of scientific research to change, to purify, to clear,
and <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘itensify’">intensify</ins> the intellectual atmosphere of Europe, and
to widen our horizon in all that pertains to the Science of Man, in
history, philology, theology, and philosophy. We have not only conquered
and annexed new worlds to the ancient empire of learning, but we have
leavened the old world with ideas that are already fermenting even in
the daily bread of our schools and universities. Most of those here
present know that I am not exaggerating; but as the world is skeptical
while listening to orations <i>pro domo</i>, I shall attempt to make
good my assertions.</p>

<p>At first, the study of Oriental literature was a matter of curiosity
only, and it is so still to a great extent, particularly in England. Sir
William Jones, whose name is the only one among Oriental scholars that
has ever obtained a real popularity in England, represents most worthily
that phase of Oriental studies.
<span class = "pagenum">323</span>
<a name = "page323" id = "page323"> </a>
Read only the two volumes of his life, and they will certainly leave on
your mind the distinct impression that Sir William Jones was not only a
man of extensive learning and refined taste, but undoubtedly a very
great man&mdash;one in a million. He was a good classical scholar of the
old school, a&nbsp;well-read historian, a&nbsp;thoughtful lawyer,
a&nbsp;clear-headed politician, and a true gentleman, in the old sense
of the word. He moved in the best, I&nbsp;mean the most cultivated
society, the great writers and thinkers of the day listened to him with
respect, and say what you like, we still live by his grace, we still
draw on that stock of general interest which he excited in the English
mind for Eastern subjects.</p>

<p>Yet the interest which Sir William Jones took in Oriental literature
was purely æsthetic. He chose what was beautiful in Persian and
translated it, as he would translate an ode of Horace. He was charmed
with Kâlidâsa’s play of “Sakuntala”&mdash;and who is not?&mdash;and he
left us his classical reproduction of one of the finest of Eastern gems.
Being a judge in India, he thought it his duty to acquaint himself with
the native law-books in their original language, and he gave us his
masterly translation of the “Laws of Manu.” Sir William Jones was fully
aware of the startling similarity between Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek.
More than a hundred years ago, in a letter written to Prince Adam
Czartoryski, in the year 1770, he says: “Many learned investigators of
antiquity are fully persuaded, that a very old and almost primeval
language was in use among the northern nations, from which not only the
Celtic dialect, but even Greek and Latin are derived; in fact, we find
<span class = "greek" title = "patêr">πατήρ</span> and <span class =
"greek" title = "mêtêr">μήτηρ</span> in Persian, nor is <span class =
"greek" title = "thugatêr">θυγάτηρ</span> so far removed
<span class = "pagenum">324</span>
<a name = "page324" id = "page324"> </a>
from <i>dockter</i>, or even <span class = "greek" title =
"onoma">ὄνομα</span> and <i>nomen</i> from Persian <i>nâm</i>, as to
make it ridiculous to suppose that they sprang from the same root. We
must confess,” he adds, “that these researches are very obscure and
uncertain, and you will allow, not so agreeable as an ode of Hafez, or
an elegy of Amr’alkeis.” In a letter, dated 1787, he says: “You will be
surprised at the resemblance between Sanskrit and both Greek and
Latin.”</p>

<p>Colebrooke also, the great successor of Sir William Jones, was fully
aware of the relationship between Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, German, and
even Slavonic. I&nbsp;possess some curious MS. notes of his, of the year
1801 or 1802, containing long lists of words, expressive of the most
essential ideas of primitive life, and which he proved to be identical
in Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, German, and Slavonic.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI_1" id = "tagVI_1" href = "#noteVI_1">1</a></p>

<p>Yet neither Colebrooke nor Sir William Jones perceived the full
import of these facts. Sir William Jones died young; Colebrooke’s
energies, marvelous as they were, were partly absorbed by official work,
so that it was left to German and French scholars to bring to light the
full wealth of the mine which those great English scholars had been the
first to open. We know now that in language, and in all that is implied
by language, India and Europe are one; but to prove this, against the
incredulity of all the greatest scholars of the day, was no easy matter.
It could be done effectually in one way only, viz., by giving to
Oriental studies a strictly scientific character, by requiring from
Oriental students not only the devotion
<span class = "pagenum">325</span>
<a name = "page325" id = "page325"> </a>
of an <i>amateur</i>, but the same thoroughness, minuteness, and
critical accuracy which were long considered the exclusive property of
Greek and Latin scholars. I&nbsp;could not think of giving here a
history of the work done during the last fifty years. It has been
admirably described in Benfey’s “History of the Science of Language.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI_2" id = "tagVI_2" href = "#noteVI_2">2</a>
Even if I attempted to give merely the names of those who have been most
distinguished by really original discoveries&mdash;the names of Bopp,
Pott, Grimm, Burnouf, Rawlinson, Miklosich, Benfey, Kuhn, Zeuss,
Whitley, Stokes&mdash;I am afraid my list would be considered very
incomplete.</p>

<p>But let us look at what has been achieved by these men, and many
others who followed their banners! The East, formerly a land of dreams,
of fables, and fairies, has become to us a land of unmistakable reality;
the curtain between the West and the East has been lifted, and our old
forgotten home stands before us again in bright colors and definite
outlines. Two worlds, separated for thousands of years, have been
reunited as by a magic spell, and we feel rich in a past that may well
be the pride of our noble Aryan family. We say no longer vaguely and
poetically <i>Ex Oriente Lux</i>, but we know that all the most vital
elements of our knowledge and civilization,&mdash;our languages, our
alphabets, our figures, our weights and measures, our art, our religion,
our traditions, our very nursery stories, come to us from the East; and
we must confess that but for the rays of Eastern light, whether Aryan or
Semitic or Hamitic, that called forth the hidden germs of the dark and
dreary West, Europe, now the very light of the world, might
<span class = "pagenum">326</span>
<a name = "page326" id = "page326"> </a>
have remained forever a barren and forgotten promontory of the primeval
Asiatic continent. We live indeed in a new world; the barrier between
the West and the East, that seemed insurmountable, has vanished. The
East is ours, we are its heirs, and claim by right our share in its
inheritance.</p>

<p>We know what it was for the Northern nations, the old barbarians of
Europe, to be brought into spiritual contact with Rome and Greece, and
to learn that beyond the small, poor world in which they had moved,
there was an older, richer, brighter world, the ancient world of Rome
and Athens, with its arts and laws, its poetry and philosophy, all of
which they might call their own and make their own by claiming the
heritage of the past. We know how, from that time, the Classical and
Teutonic spirits mingled together and formed that stream of modern
thought on whose shores we ourselves live and move. A&nbsp;new stream is
now being brought into the same bed, the stream of Oriental thought, and
already the colors of the old stream show very clearly the influence of
that new tributary. Look at any of the important works published during
the last twenty years, not only on language, but on literature,
mythology, law, religion, and philosophy, and you will see on every page
the working of a new spirit. I&nbsp;do not say that the East can ever
teach us new things, but it can place before us old things, and leave us
to draw from them lessons more strange and startling than anything
dreamt of in our philosophy.</p>

<p>Before all, a study of the East has taught us the same lesson which
the Northern nations once learnt in Rome and Athens, that there are
other worlds beside our own, that there are other religions, other
<span class = "pagenum">327</span>
<a name = "page327" id = "page327"> </a>
mythologies, other laws, and that the history of philosophy from Thales
to Hegel is not the whole history of human thought. In all these
subjects the East has supplied us with parallels, and with all that is
implied in parallels, viz., the possibility of comparing, measuring, and
understanding. The <i>comparative spirit</i> is the truly scientific
spirit of our age, nay of all ages. An empirical acquaintance with
single facts does not constitute knowledge in the true sense of the
word. All human knowledge begins with the Two or the Dyad, the
comprehension of two single things as one. If in these days we may still
quote Aristotle, we may boldly say that “there is no science of that
which is unique.” A&nbsp;single event may be purely accidental, it comes
and goes, it is inexplicable, it does not call for an explanation. But
as soon as the same fact is repeated, the work of comparison begins, and
the first step is made in that wonderful process which we call
generalization, and which is at the root of all intellectual knowledge
and of all intellectual language. This primitive process of comparison
is repeated again and again, and when we now give the title of
<i>Comparative</i> to the highest kind of knowledge in every branch of
science, we have only replaced the old word <i>intelligent</i>
(<i>i.e.</i>, interligent) or inter-twining, by a new and more
expressive term, <i>comparative</i>. I shall say nothing about the
complete revolution of the study of languages by means of the
comparative method, for here I can appeal to such names as Mommsen and
Curtius, to show that the best among classical scholars are themselves
the most ready to acknowledge the importance of the results obtained by
the intertwining of Eastern and Western philology.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">328</span>
<a name = "page328" id = "page328"> </a>
<p>But take mythology. As long as we had only the mythology of the
classical nations to deal with, we looked upon it simply as strange,
anomalous, and irrational. When, however, the same strange stories, the
same hallucinations, turned up in the most ancient mythology of India,
when not only the character and achievements, but the very names of some
of the gods and heroes were found to be the same, then every thoughtful
observer saw that there must be a system in that ancient madness, that
there must be some order in that strange mob of gods and heroes, and
that it must be the task of comparative mythology to find out, what
reason there is in all that mass of unreason.</p>

<p>The same comparative method has been applied to the study of religion
also. All religions are Oriental, and with the exception of the
Christian, their sacred books are all written in Oriental languages. The
materials, therefore, for a comparative study of the religious systems
of the world had all to be supplied by Oriental scholars. But far more
important than those materials, is the spirit in which they have been
treated. The sacred books of the principal religions of mankind had to
be placed side by side with perfect impartiality, in order to discern
the points which they share in common as well as those that are peculiar
to each. The results already obtained by this simple juxtaposition are
full of important lessons, and the fact that the truths on which all
religions agree far exceed those on which they differ, has hardly been
sufficiently appreciated. I&nbsp;feel convinced, however, that the time
will come when those who at present profess to be most disquieted by our
studies, will be the most grateful for our support,&mdash;for having
<span class = "pagenum">329</span>
<a name = "page329" id = "page329"> </a>
shown by evidence which cannot be controverted, that all religions
spring from the same sacred soil, the human heart; that all are
quickened by the same divine spirit, the still small voice; and that,
though the outward forms of religion may change, may wither and decay,
yet, as long as man is what he is and what he has been, he will
postulate again and again the Infinite as the very condition of the
Finite, he will yearn for something which the world cannot give, he will
feel his weakness and dependence, and in that weakness and dependence
discover the deepest sources of his hope, and trust, and strength.</p>

<p>A patient study of the sacred scriptures of the world is what is
wanted at present more than anything else, in order to clear our own
ideas of the origin, the nature, the purposes of religion. There can be
no science of one religion, but there can be a science of many. We have
learnt already one lesson, that behind the helpless expressions which
language has devised, whether in the East or in the West, for uttering
the unutterable, be it <i>Dyaushpitâ</i> or <i>Ahuramazda</i>, be it
<i>Jehovah</i> or <i>Allah</i>, be it the All or the Nothing, be it the
First Cause or Our Father in heaven, there is the same intention, the
same striving, the same stammering, the same faith. Other lessons will
follow, till in the end we shall be able to restore that ancient bond
which unites not only the East with the West, but all the members of the
human family, and may learn to understand what a Persian poet meant when
he wrote many centuries ago (I&nbsp;quote from Mr. Conway’s “Sacred
Anthology”), “Diversity of worship has divided the human race into
seventy-two nations. From among all their dogmas I have selected
one&mdash;the Love of God.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">330</span>
<a name = "page330" id = "page330"> </a>
<p>Nor is this comparative spirit restricted to the treatment of
language, mythology, and religion. While hitherto we knew the origin and
spreading of most of the ancient arts and sciences in one channel only,
and had to be satisfied with tracing their sources to Greece and Rome,
and thence down the main stream of European civilization, we have now
for many of them one or two parallel histories in India and in China.
The history of geometry, for instance,&mdash;the first formation of
geometrical conceptions or technical terms&mdash;was hitherto known to
us from Greece only: now we can compare the gradual elaboration of
geometrical principles both in Greece and India, and thus arrive at some
idea of what is natural or inevitable, and what is accidental or purely
personal in each. It was known, for instance, that in Greece the
calculation of solid figures began with the building of altars, and you
will hear to-day from Dr. Thibaut, that in India also the first impulse
to geometric science was given, not by the measuring of fields, as the
name implies, but by the minute observances in building altars.</p>

<p>Similar coincidences and divergences have been brought to light by a
comparative study of the history of astronomy, of music, of grammar,
but, most of all, by a comparative study of philosophic thought. There
are indeed few problems in philosophy which have not occupied the Indian
mind, and nothing can exceed the interest of watching the Hindu and the
Greek, working on the same problems, each in his own way, yet both in
the end arriving at much the same results. Such are the coincidences
between the two, that but lately an eminent German professor,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVI_3" id = "tagVI_3" href = "#noteVI_3">3</a>
<span class = "pagenum">331</span>
<a name = "page331" id = "page331"> </a>
published a treatise to show that the Greeks had borrowed their
philosophy from India, while others lean to the opinion that in
philosophy the Hindus are the pupils of the Greeks. This is the same
feeling which impelled Dugald Stewart, when he saw the striking
similarity between Greek and Sanskrit, to maintain that Sanskrit must
have been put together after the model of Greek and Latin by those
arch-forgers and liars, the Brahmans, and that the whole of Sanskrit
literature was an imposition. The comparative method has put an end to
such violent theories. It teaches us that what is possible in one
country is possible also in another; it shows us that, as there are
antecedents for Plato and Aristotle in Greece, there are antecedents for
the Vedânta and Sânkhya philosophies in India, and that each had its own
independent growth. It is true, that when we first meet in Indian
philosophy with our old friends, the four or five elements, the atoms,
our metaphysics, our logic, our syllogism, we are startled; but we soon
discover that, given the human mind and human language, and the world by
which we are surrounded, the different systems of philosophy of Thales
and Hegel, of Vyâsa and Kapila, are inevitable solutions. They all come
and go, they are maintained and refuted, till at last all philosophy
ends where it ought to begin, with an inquiry into the necessary
conditions and the inevitable forms of knowledge, represented by a
criticism of Pure Reason and, what is more important still, by a
criticism of Language.</p>

<p>Much has been done of late for Indian philosophy, particularly by
Ballantyne and Hall, by Cowell and Gough, by the editors of the
“Bibliotheca Indica,” and the “Pandit.” Yet it is much to be desired,
that

some young scholars, well versed in the history of European philosophy,
should devote themselves more ardently to this promising branch of
Indian literature. No doubt they would find it a great help, if they
were able to spend some years in India, in order to learn from the last
and fast disappearing representatives of some of the old schools of
Indian philosophy what they alone can teach. What can be done by such a
combination of Eastern and Western knowledge, has lately been shown by
the excellent work done by Dr. Kielhorn, the Professor of Sanskrit at
the Deccan College in Punah. But there is now so much of published
materials, and Sanskrit MSS. also are so easily obtained from India,
that much might be done in England, or in France, or in
Germany&mdash;much that would be of interest not only to Oriental
scholars, but to all philosophers whose powers of independent
appreciation are not entirely blunted by their study of Plato and
Aristotle, of Berkeley, Hume, and Kant.</p>

<p>I have so far dwelt chiefly on the powerful influence which the East,
and more particularly India, has exercised on the intellectual life and
work of the West. But the progress of Oriental scholarship in Europe,
and the discovery of that spiritual relationship which binds India and
England together, have likewise produced practical effects of the
greatest moment in the East. The Hindus, in their first intercourse with
English scholars, placed before them the treasures of their native
literature with all the natural pride of a nation that considered itself
the oldest, the wisest, the most enlightened nation in the world. For a
time, but for a short time only, the claims of their literature to a
fabulous antiquity were admitted, and dazzled by the unexpected
discovery of a new classical literature,
<span class = "pagenum">333</span>
<a name = "page333" id = "page333"> </a>
people raved about the beauty of Sanskrit poetry in truly Oriental
strains. Then followed a sudden reaction, and the natives themselves, on
becoming more and more acquainted with European history and literature,
began to feel the childishness of their claims, and to be almost ashamed
of their own classics. This was a national misfortune. A&nbsp;people
that can feel no pride in the past, in its history and literature, loses
the mainstay of its national character. When Germany was in the very
depth of its political degradation, it turned to its ancient literature,
and drew hope for the future from the study of the past. Something of
the same kind is now passing in India. A&nbsp;new taste, not without
some political ingredients, has sprung up for the ancient literature of
the country; a&nbsp;more intelligent appreciation of their real merits
has taken the place of the extravagant admiration for the masterworks of
their old poets; there is a revival in the study of Sanskrit,
a&nbsp;surprising activity in the republication of Sanskrit texts, and
there are traces among the Hindus of a growing feeling, not very
different from that which Tacitus described, when he said of the
Germans: “Who would go to Germany, a&nbsp;country without natural
beauty, with a wretched climate, miserable to cultivate or to look
at&mdash;<i>unless it be his fatherland</i>?”</p>

<p>Even the discovery that Sanskrit, English, Greek, and Latin are
cognate languages, has not been without its influence on the scholars
and thinkers, or the leaders of public opinion, in India. They, more
than others, had felt for a time most keenly the intellectual
superiority of the West, and they rose again in their own estimation by
learning that, physically, or at all events, intellectually, they had
been and might be
<span class = "pagenum">334</span>
<a name = "page334" id = "page334"> </a>
again, the peers of Greeks and Romans and Saxons. These silent
influences often escape the eye of the politician and the historian, but
at critical moments they decide the fate of whole nations and empires.<a

"#noteVI_4">4,</a><a class = "tag" href = "#chapVI_noteA">A</a></p>

<p>The intellectual life of India at the present moment is full of
interesting problems. It is too much the fashion to look only at its
darker sides, and to forget that such intellectual regenerations as we
are witnessing in India, are impossible without convulsions and
failures. A&nbsp;new race of men is growing up in India, who have
stepped, as it were, over a thousand years, and have entered at once on
the intellectual inheritance of Europe. They carry off prizes at English
schools, take their degrees in English universities, and are in every
respect our equals. They have temptations which we have not, and now and
then they succumb; but we, too, have temptations of our own, and we do
not always resist. One can hardly trust one’s eyes in reading their
writings, whether in English or Bengali, many of which would reflect
credit on our own Quarterlies. With regard to what is of the greatest
interest to us, their scholarship, it is true that the old school of
Sanskrit scholars is dying out, and much will die with it which we shall
never recover; but a new and most promising school of Sanskrit students,
educated by European professors, is springing up, and they will, nay, to
judge from recent controversies, they have already become most
formidable rivals to our own scholars. The essays of Dr. Bhao Daji,
whom, I&nbsp;regret to say, we have lately lost by death, on disputed
points in Indian archæology and literature, are most valuable. The
indefatigable Rajendra Lal Mitra is rendering most excellent service in
the publications of the Asiatic Society at Calcutta,
<span class = "pagenum">335</span>
<a name = "page335" id = "page335"> </a>
and he discusses the theories of European Orientalists with all the ease
and grace of an English reviewer. The Râjah of Besmah,
Giriprasâda-sinha, has just finished his magnificent edition of the
“White Yajurveda.” The Sanskrit books published at Calcutta by
Târânâtha, and others, form a complete library, and Târânâtha’s new
“Dictionary of the Sanskrit Language” will prove most useful and
valuable. The editions of Sanskrit texts published at Bombay by
Professor <span class = "sanskrit">Bhâṇḍârkar</span>, Shankar Pandurang
Pandit, and others, need not fear comparison with the best work of
European scholars. There is a school of native students at Benares whose
publications, under the auspices of Mr. Griffith, have made their
journal, the “Pandit,” indispensable to every Sanskrit scholar.
Râjârâmasâstrî’s and Bâlaśâstrî’s edition of the “Mahâbhâshya” has
received the highest praise from European students. In the “Antiquary,”
a&nbsp;paper very ably conducted by Mr. Burgess, we meet with
contributions from several learned natives, among them from his Highness
the Prince of Travancore, from Ram Dass Sen, the Zemindar of Berhampore,
from Kâshinâth Trimbak Telang, from Sashagiriśâstrî, and others, which
are read with the greatest interest and advantage by European scholars.
The collected essays of Ram Dass Sen well deserve a translation into
English, and Rajanîkânta’s “Life of the Poet Jajadeva,” just published,
bears witness to the same revival of literary tastes and patriotic
feelings.</p>

<p>Besides this purely literary movement, there is a religious movement
going on in India, the Brahmo-Samâj, which, both in its origin and its
later development, is mainly the result of European influences. It began
with an attempt to bring the modern corrupt
<span class = "pagenum">336</span>
<a name = "page336" id = "page336"> </a>
forms of worship back to the purity and simplicity of the Vedas; and by
ascribing to the Veda the authority of a Divine Revelation, it was hoped
to secure that infallible authority without which no religion was
supposed to be possible. How was that movement stopped, and turned into
a new channel? Simply by the publication of the Veda, and by the works
of European scholars, such as Stevenson, Mill, Rosen, Wilson, and
others, who showed to the natives what the Veda really was, and made
them see the folly of their way.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_5" id =
"tagVI_5" href = "#noteVI_5">5,</a><a class = "tag" href =
"#chapVI_noteB">B</a> Thus the religion, the literature, the whole
character of the people of India are becoming more and more
Indo-European. They work for us, as we work for them. Many a letter have
I received from native scholars in which they express their admiration
for the wonderful achievements of European ingenuity, for railways, and
telegraphs, and all the rest; and yet what, according to their own
confession, has startled them and delighted them most, is the interest
we have taken in their literature, and the new life which we have
imparted to their ancient history. I&nbsp;know these matters seem small,
when we are near to them, when we are in the very midst of them. Like
the tangled threads hanging on a loom, they look worthless, purposeless.
But history weaves her woof out of all of them, and after a time, when
we see the full and finished design, we perceive that no color, however
quiet, could have been dropped, no shade, however slight, could have
been missed, without spoiling the whole.</p>

<p>And now, after having given this account of our stewardship, let me
say in conclusion a few words on the claims which Oriental studies have
on public sympathy and support.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">337</span>
<a name = "page337" id = "page337"> </a>
<p>Let me begin with the Universities&mdash;I mean, of course the
English Universities&mdash;and more particularly that University which
has been to me for many years an <i>Alma Mater</i>, Oxford. While we
have there, or are founding there, professorships for every branch of
Theology, Jurisprudence, and Physical Science, we have hardly any
provision for the study of Oriental languages. We have a chair of
Hebrew, rendered illustrious by the greatest living theologian of
England, and we have a chair of Sanskrit, which has left its mark in the
history of Sanskrit literature; but for the modern languages of India,
whether Aryan or Dravidian, for the language and literature of Persia,
both ancient and modern, for the language and antiquities of Egypt and
Babylon, for Chinese, for Turkish, nay even for Arabic, there is nothing
deserving the name of a chair. When in a Report on University Reform,
I&nbsp;ventured to point out these gaps, and to remark that in the
smallest of German Universities most of these subjects were represented
by professors, I&nbsp;was asked whether I was in earnest in maintaining
that Oxford, the first University in what has rightly been called the
greatest Oriental Empire, ought really to support the study of Oriental
languages.</p>

<p>The second claim we prefer is on the Missionary Societies. I have
lately incurred very severe obloquy for my supposed hostility to
missionary enterprise. All I can say is, I&nbsp;wish that there were ten
missionaries for every one we have now. I&nbsp;have always counted
missionaries among my best friends; I&nbsp;have again and again
acknowledged how much Oriental studies and linguistic studies in
general, owe to them, and I am proud to say that, even now,
<span class = "pagenum">338</span>
<a name = "page338" id = "page338"> </a>
while missionaries at home have abused me in unmeasured language,
missionaries abroad, devoted, hard-working missionaries, have thanked me
for what I said of them and their work in my lay-sermon in Westminster
Abbey last December.</p>

<p>Now it seems to me that, first of all, our Universities, and I think
again chiefly of Oxford, might do much more for missions than they do at
present. If we had a sufficient staff of professors for Eastern
languages, we could prepare young missionaries for their work, and
should be able to send out from time to time such men as Patteson, the
Bishop of Melanesia, who was every inch an Oxford man. And in these
missionaries we might have not only apostles of religion and
civilization, but at the same time, the most valuable pioneers of
scientific research. I&nbsp;know there are some authorities at home who
declare that such a combination is impossible, or at least undesirable;
that a man cannot serve two masters, and that a missionary must do his
own work and nothing else. Nothing, I&nbsp;believe, can be more
mistaken. First of all, some of our most efficient missionaries have
been those who have done also the most excellent work as scholars, and
whenever I have conversed on this subject with missionaries who have
seen active service, they all agree that they cannot be converting all
day long, and that nothing is more refreshing and invigorating to them
than some literary or scientific work. Now what I should like to see is
this: I&nbsp;should like to see ten or twenty of our non-resident
fellowships, which at present are doing more harm than good, assigned to
missionary work, to be given to young men who have taken their degree,
and who, whether
<span class = "pagenum">339</span>
<a name = "page339" id = "page339"> </a>
laymen or clergymen, are willing to work as assistant missionaries on
distant stations, with the distinct understanding that they should
devote some of their time to scientific work, whether the study of
languages, or flowers, or stars, and that they should send home every
year some account of their labors. These men would be like scientific
consuls, to whom students at home might apply for information and help.
They would have opportunities of distinguishing themselves by really
useful work, far more than in London, and after ten years, they might
either return to Europe with a well-established reputation, or if they
find that they have a real call for missionary work, devote all their
life to it. Though to my own mind there is no nobler work than that of a
missionary, yet I believe that some such connection with the
Universities and men of science would raise their position, and would
call out more general interest, and secure to the missionary cause the
good-will of those whose will is apt to become law.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I think that Oriental studies have a claim on the colonies
and the colonial governments. The English colonies are scattered all
over the globe, and many of them in localities where an immense deal of
useful scientific work might be done, and would be done with the
slightest encouragement from the local authorities, and something like a
systematic supervision on the part of the Colonial Office at home. Some
years ago I ventured to address the Colonial Secretary of State on this
subject, and a letter was sent out in consequence to all the English
colonies, inviting information on the languages, monuments, customs, and
traditions of the native
<span class = "pagenum">340</span>
<a name = "page340" id = "page340"> </a>
races. Some most valuable reports have been sent home during the last
five or six years, but when it was suggested that these reports should
be published in a permanent form, the expense that would have been
required for printing every year a volume of Colonial Reports, and which
would not have amounted to more than a few hundred pounds for all the
colonies of the British Empire, part of it to be recovered by the sale
of the book, was considered too large.</p>

<p>Now we should bear in mind that at the present moment some of the
tribes living in or near the English colonies in Australia, Polynesia,
Africa, and America, are actually dying out, their languages are
disappearing, their customs, traditions, and religions will soon be
completely swept away. To the student of language, the dialect of a
savage tribe is as valuable as Sanskrit or Hebrew, nay, for the solution
of certain problems, more so; every one of these languages is the growth
of thousands and thousands of years, the workmanship of millions and
millions of human beings. If they were now preserved, they might
hereafter fill the most critical gaps in the history of the human race.
At Rome at the time of the Scipios, hundreds of people might have
written down a grammar and dictionary of the Etruscan language, of
Oscan, or Umbrian; but there were men then, as there are now, who
shrugged their shoulders and said, What can be the use of preserving
these barbarous, uncouth idioms?&mdash;What would we not give now for
some such records?</p>

<p>And this is not all. The study of savage tribes has assumed a new
interest of late, when the question of the exact relation of man to the
rest of the animal
<span class = "pagenum">341</span>
<a name = "page341" id = "page341"> </a>
kingdom has again roused the passions not only of scientific inquirers,
but also of the public at large. Now what is wanted for the solution of
this question, are more facts and fewer theories, and these facts can
only be gained by a patient study of the lowest races of mankind. When
religion was held to be the specific character of man, it was asserted
by many travellers that they had seen races without any religious ideas;
when language was seen to be the real frontier line between man and
beast, it was maintained that there were human beings without language.
Now all we want to know are facts, let the conclusions be whatever they
may. It is by no means easy to decide whether savage tribes have a
religion or not; at all events it requires the same discernment, and the
same honesty of purpose as to find out whether men of the highest
intellect among us have a religion or not. I&nbsp;call the Introduction
to Spencer’s “First Principles” deeply religious, but I can well
understand that a missionary, reporting on a tribe of Spencerian
savages, might declare that they had no idea whatsoever of religion.
Looking at a report sent home lately by the indefatigable Governor of
New South Wales, Sir Hercules Robinson, I&nbsp;find the following
description of the religious ideas of the Kamilarois, one of the most
degraded tribes in the Northwestern district of the <span class =
"locked">colony:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Bhaiami is regarded by them as the maker of all things. The name
signifies ‘maker,’ or ‘cutter-out,’ from the verb <em>bhai</em>,
<em>baialli</em>, <em>baia</em>. He is regarded as the rewarder and
punisher of men according to their conduct. He sees all, and knows all,
if not directly, through the subordinate deity Turramûlan, who presides
at the Bora. Bhaiami is said to have
<span class = "pagenum">342</span>
<a name = "page342" id = "page342"> </a>
been once on the earth. Turramûlan is mediator in all the operations of
Bhaiami upon man, and in all man’s transactions with Bhaiami. Turramûlan
means ‘leg on one side only,’ ‘one-legged.’”</p>

<p>This description is given by the Rev. C. Greenway, and if there is
any theological bias in it, let us make allowance for it. But there
remains the fact that Bhaiami, their name for deity, comes from a root
<em>bhai</em>, to “make,” to “cut out,” and if we remember that hardly
any of the names for deity, either among the Aryan or Semitic nations,
comes from a root with so abstract a meaning, we shall admit,
I&nbsp;think, that such reports as these should not be allowed to lie
forgotten in the pigeon-holes of the Colonial Office, or in the pages of
a monthly journal.</p>

<p>What applies to religion, applies to language. We have been told
again and again that the Veddahs in Ceylon have no language. Sir Emerson
Tennant wrote “that they mutually make themselves understood by signs,
grimaces, and guttural sounds, which have little resemblance to definite
words or language in general.” When these statements were repeated,
I&nbsp;tried to induce the Government of Ceylon to send a competent man
to settle the question. I&nbsp;did not receive all I wanted, and
therefore postponed the publication of what was sent me. But I may say
so much, that more than half of the words used by the Veddahs, are, like
Singhalese itself, mere corruption of Sanskrit; their very name is the
Sanskrit word for hunter, <em>veddhâ</em>, or, as Mr. Childers supposes,
<em>vyâdha</em>. There is a remnant of words in their language of which
I can make nothing as yet. But so much is certain; either the Veddahs
started with the common inheritance of Aryan words and ideas;
<span class = "pagenum">343</span>
<a name = "page343" id = "page343"> </a>
or, at all events, they lived for a long time in contact with Aryan
people, and adopted from them such words as were wanting in their
language. If they now stand low in the scale of humanity, they once
stood higher, nay they may possibly prove, in language, if not in blood,
the distant cousins of Plato, and Newton, and Goethe.</p>

<p>It is most essential to keep <i>la carrière ouverte</i> for facts,
even more than for theories, and for the supply of such facts the
Colonial Government might render most useful service.</p>

<p>It is but right to state that whenever I have applied to the
Governors of any of the Colonies, I&nbsp;have invariably met with the
greatest kindness and readiness to help. Some of them take the warmest
interest in these researches. Sir George Grey’s services to the science
of language have hardly been sufficiently appreciated as yet, and the
Linguistic Library which he founded at the Cape, places him of right by
the side of Sir Thomas Bodley. Sir Hercules Robinson, Mr. Musgrave in
South Australia, Sir Henry Barkley at the Cape, and several others, are
quite aware of the importance of linguistic and ethnological researches.
What is wanted is encouragement from home, and some systematic guidance.
Dr. Bleek, the excellent librarian of Sir George Grey’s Library at the
Cape, who has devoted the whole of his life to the study of savage
dialects, and whose Comparative Grammar of the South African languages
will hold its place by the side of Bopp’s, Diez’s, and Caldwell’s
Comparative Grammars, is most anxious that there should be a permanent
linguistic and ethnological station established at the Cape; in fact,
that there should be a linguist
<span class = "pagenum">344</span>
<a name = "page344" id = "page344"> </a>
attached to every zoölogical station. At the Cape there are not only the
Zulu dialects to be studied, but two most important languages, that of
the Hottentots and that of the Bushmen. Dr. Bleek has lately been
enabled to write down several volumes of traditional literature from the
mouths of some Bushman prisoners, but he says, “my powers and my life
are drawing to an end, and unless I have some young men to assist me,
and carry on my work, much of what I have done will be lost.” There is
no time to be lost, and I trust therefore that my appeal will not be
considered importunate by the present Colonial Minister.</p>

<p>Last of all, we turn to India, the very cradle of Oriental
scholarship, and here, instead of being importunate and urging new
claims for assistance, I&nbsp;think I am expressing the feelings of all
Oriental scholars in publicly acknowledging the readiness with which the
Indian Government, whether at home or in India, whether during the days
of the old East India Company, or now under the auspices of the
Secretary of State, has always assisted every enterprise tending to
throw light on the literature, the religion, the laws and customs, the
arts and manufactures of that ancient Oriental Empire.</p>

<p>Only last night I received the first volume of a work which will mark
a new era in the history of Oriental typography. Three valuable MSS. of
the Mahâbhâshya have been photolithographed at the expense of the Indian
Government, and under the supervision of one whom many of us will miss
here to-day, the late Professor Goldstücker. It is a magnificent
publication, and as there are only fifty copies printed, it will soon
become more valuable than a real MS.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">345</span>
<a name = "page345" id = "page345"> </a>
<p>There are two surveys carried on at the present moment in India,
a&nbsp;literary and an archæological survey. Many years ago, when Lord
Elgin went to India as Governor-general, I&nbsp;suggested to him the
necessity of taking measures in order to rescue from destruction
whatever could still be rescued of the ancient literature of the
country. Lord Elgin died before any active measures could be taken, but
the plan found a more powerful advocate in Mr. Whitley Stokes, who urged
the Government to appoint some Sanskrit scholars to visit all places
containing collections of Sanskrit MSS., and to publish lists of their
titles, so that we might know, at all events, how much of a literature,
that had been preserved for thousands of years, was still in existence
at the present moment. This work was confided to Dr. Bühler, Dr.
Kielhorn, Mr. Burnell, Rajendralal Mitra, and others. Several of their
catalogues have been published, and there is but one feeling among all
Sanskrit scholars as to the value of their work. But they also feel that
the time has come for doing more. The mere titles of the MSS. whet our
appetite, but do not satisfy it. There are, of course, hundreds of books
where the title, the name of the author, the <i>locus et annus</i> are
all we care to know. But of books which are scarce, and hitherto not
known out of India, we want to know more. We want some information of
the subject and its treatment, and if possible, of the date, of the
author, and of the writers quoted by him. We want extracts,
intelligently chosen, in fact, we want something like the excellent
catalogue which Dr. Aufrecht has made for the Bodleian Library. In Mr.
Burnell, Dr. Bühler, Dr. Kielhorn, the Government possesses scholars who
<span class = "pagenum">346</span>
<a name = "page346" id = "page346"> </a>
could do that work admirably; what they want is more leisure, more
funds, more assistance.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with the Literary Survey, there is the
Archæological Survey, carried on by that gallant and indefatigable
scholar, General Cunningham. His published reports show the systematic
progress of his work, and his occasional communications in the Journal
of the Asiatic Society of Bengal tell us of his newest discoveries. The
very last number of that journal brought us the news of the discovery of
the wonderful ruins of the Buddhist temple of Bharahut,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVI_6" id = "tagVI_6" href = "#noteVI_6">6</a> which, with
their representations of scenes from the early Buddhist literature, with
their inscriptions and architectural style, may enable us to find a
<i>terminus a quo</i> for the literary and religious history of India.
We should not forget the services which Mr. Fergusson has rendered to
the history of Indian architecture, both by awakening an interest in the
subject, and by the magnificent publication of the drawings of the
sculptures of Sanchi and Amravati, carried on under the authority of the
Secretary of State for India. Let us hope that these new discoveries may
supply him with materials for another volume, worthy of its
companion.</p>

<p>It was supposed for a time that there was a third survey carried on
in India, ethnological and linguistic, and the volume, published by
Colonel Dalton, “Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal,” with portraits from
photographs, was a most excellent beginning. But the other India
Governments have not hitherto followed the example of the Bengal
Government, and nothing has of late come to my knowledge in this
important line of research. Would not Dr.
<span class = "pagenum">347</span>
<a name = "page347" id = "page347"> </a>
Hunter, who has done so much for a scientific study of the non-Aryan
languages and races of India, take up this important branch of research,
and give us, not only photographs and graphic description, but also,
what is most wanted, scholarlike grammars of the principal races of
India? Lists of words, if carefully chosen, like those in Colonel
Dalton’s work and in Sir George Campbell’s “Specimens,” are, no doubt,
most valuable for preliminary researches, but without grammars, none of
the great questions which are still pending in Indian Ethnology will
ever be satisfactorily and definitely settled. No real advance has been
made in the classification of Indian dialects since the time when I
endeavored, some twenty years ago, to sum up what was then known on that
subject, in my letter to Bunsen “On the Turanian Languages.” What I then
for the first time ventured to maintain against the highest authorities
in Indian linguistic ethnology, viz., that the dialects of the Mundas or
the Koles constituted a third and totally independent class of languages
in India, related neither to the Aryan nor to the Dravidian families,
has since been fully confirmed by later researches, and is now,
I&nbsp;believe, generally accepted. The fact also, on which I then
strongly insisted, that the Uraon Koles, and Rajmahal Koles, might be
Koles in blood, but certainly not in language, their language being,
like that of the Gonds, Dravidian, is now no longer disputed. But beyond
this, all is still as hypothetical as it was twenty years ago, simply
because we can get no grammars of the Munda dialects. Why do not the
German missionaries at Ranchi, who have done such excellent work among
the Koles, publish a grammatical analysis of that
<span class = "pagenum">348</span>
<a name = "page348" id = "page348"> </a>
interesting cluster of dialects? Only a week ago, one of them, Mr.
Jellinghaus, gave me a grammatical sketch of the Mundári language, and
even this, short as it is, was quite sufficient to show that the
supposed relationship between the Munda dialects and the Khasia
language, of which we have a grammar, is untenable. The similarities
pointed out by Mason between the Munda dialects and the Talaing of Pegu,
are certainly startling, but equally startling are the divergences; and
here again no real result will be obtained without a comparison of the
grammatical structure of the two languages. The other classes of Indian
languages, the Taic, the Gangetic, subdivided into Trans-Himalayan and
Sub-Himalayan, the Lohitic, and Tamulic, are still retained, though some
of their names have been changed. Without wishing to defend the names
which I had chosen for these classes, I&nbsp;must say that I look upon
the constant introduction of new technical terms as an unmixed evil.
Every classificatory term is imperfect. Aryan, Semitic, Hamitic,
Turanian, all are imperfect, but, if they are but rightly defined, they
can do no harm, whereas a new term, however superior at first sight,
always makes confusion worse confounded. The chemists do not hesitate to
call sugar an acid rather than part with an old established term; why
should not we in the science of language follow their good example?</p>

<p>Dr. Leitner’s labors in Dardistan should here be mentioned. They date
from the year 1866. Considering the shortness of the time allotted to
him for exploring that country, he has been most successful in
collecting his linguistic materials. We owe him a vocabulary of two
Shinâ dialects (the Ghilghiti and
<span class = "pagenum">349</span>
<a name = "page349" id = "page349"> </a>
Astori), and of the Arnyia, the Khayuna, and the Kalâsha-Mânder. These
vocabularies are so arranged as to give us a fair idea of the systems of
conjugation and declension. Other vocabularies, arranged according to
subjects, allow us an insight into the intellectual life of the Shinas,
and we also receive most interesting information on the customs,
legends, superstitions, and religion of the Dardus. Some of the
important results, obtained by the same enterprising scholar in his
excavations on the Takht-i-bahai hills will be laid before the
Archæological Section of this Congress. It is impossible to look at the
Buddhist sculptures which he has brought home without perceiving that
there is in them a foreign element. They are Buddhist sculptures, but
they differ both in treatment and expression from what was hitherto
known of Buddhist art in various parts of the world. Dr. Leitner thinks
that the foreign element came from Greece, from Greek or Macedonian
workmen, the descendants of Alexander’s companions; others think that
local and individual influences are sufficient to account for apparent
deviations from the common Buddhist type. On this point I feel totally
incompetent to express an opinion, but whatever the judgment of our
archæological colleagues may be, neither they nor we ourselves can have
any doubt that Dr. Leitner deserves our sincere gratitude as an
indefatigable explorer and successful discoverer.</p>

<p>Many of the most valuable treasures of every kind and sort, collected
during these official surveys, and by private enterprise, are now
deposited in the Indian Museum in London, a&nbsp;real mine of literary
and archæological wealth, opened with the greatest liberality to all who
are willing to work in it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">350</span>
<a name = "page350" id = "page350"> </a>
<p>It is unfortunate, no doubt, that this meeting of Oriental scholars
should have taken place at a time when the treasures of the Indian
Museum are still in their temporary exile; yet, if they share in the
regret felt by every friend of India, at the delay in the building of a
new museum, worthy both of England and of India, they will also carry
away the conviction, that such delay is simply due to a desire to do the
best that can be done, in order to carry out in the end something little
short of that magnificent scheme of an Indian Institute, drawn by the
experienced hand of Mr. Forbes Watson.</p>

<p>And now, in conclusion, I have to express my own gratitude for the
liberality both of the Directors of the old East India Company and of
the present Secretary of State for India in Council, for having enabled
me to publish that work the last sheet of which I am able to present to
this Meeting to-day, the “Rig-Veda, with the Commentary of <span class =
"sanskrit">Sâyaṇâcârya</span>.” It is the oldest book of the Aryan
world, but it is also one of the largest, and its publication would have
been simply impossible without the enlightened liberality of the Indian
Government. For twenty-five years I find, that taking the large and
small editions of the Rig-Veda together, I&nbsp;have printed every year
what would make a volume of about six hundred pages octavo. Such a
publication would have ruined any bookseller, for it must be confessed,
that there is little that is attractive in the Veda, nothing that could
excite general interest. From an æsthetic point of view, no one would
care for the hymns of the Rig-Veda, and I can well understand how, in
the beginning of our century, even so discriminating a scholar as
Colebrooke could express his opinion that,
<span class = "pagenum">351</span>
<a name = "page351" id = "page351"> </a>
“The Vedas are too voluminous for a complete translation, and what they
contain would hardly reward the labor of the reader, much less that of
the translator. The ancient dialect in which they are composed, and
specially that of the three first Vedas, is extremely difficult and
obscure; and, though curious, as the parent of a more polished and
refined language, its difficulties must long continue to prevent such an
examination of the whole Vedas, as would be requisite for extracting all
that is remarkable and important in those voluminous works. But they
well deserve to be occasionally consulted by the Oriental scholar.”
Nothing shows the change from the purely æsthetic to the purely
scientific interest in the language and literature of India more clearly
than the fact that for the last twenty-five years the work of nearly all
Sanskrit scholars has been concentrated on the Veda. When some thirty
years ago I received my first lessons in Sanskrit from Professor
Brockhaus, whom I am happy and proud to see to-day among us, there were
but few students who ventured to dive into the depths of Vedic
literature. To-day among the Sanskrit scholars whom Germany has sent to
us&mdash;Professors Stenzler, Spiegel, Weber, Hang, Pertsch,
Windisch&mdash;there is not one who has not won his laurels on the field
of Vedic scholarship. In France also a new school of Sanskrit students
has sprung up who have done most excellent work for the interpretation
of the Veda, and who bid fair to rival the glorious school of French
Orientalists at the beginning of this century, both by their persevering
industry and by that “sweetness and light” which seems to be the
birthright of their nation. But, I&nbsp;say again, there is little that
is beautiful, in our sense of the
<span class = "pagenum">352</span>
<a name = "page352" id = "page352"> </a>
word, to be found in the hymns of the Rig-Veda, and what little there
is, has been so often dwelt on, that quite an erroneous impression as to
the real nature of Vedic poetry has been produced in the mind of the
public. My old friend, the Dean of St. Paul’s, for instance, in some
thoughtful lectures which he delivered this year on the “Sacred Poetry
of Early Religions,” has instituted a comparison between the Psalms and
the hymns of the Veda, and he arrives at the conclusion that the Psalms
are superior to the Vedic hymns. No doubt they are, from the point of
view which he has chosen, but the chief value of these hymns lies in the
fact that they are so different from the Psalms, or, if you like, that
they are so inferior to the Psalms. They are Aryan, the Psalms Semitic;
they belong to a primitive and rude state of society, the Psalms, at
least most of them, are contemporaneous with or even later than the
heydays of the Jewish monarchy. This strange misconception of the true
character of the Vedic hymns seemed to me to become so general, that
when some years ago I had to publish the first volume of my translation,
I&nbsp;intentionally selected a class of hymns which should in no way
encourage such erroneous opinions. It was interesting to watch the
disappointment. What, it was said, are these strange, savage, grotesque
invocations of the Storm-gods, the inspired strains of the ancient sages
of India? Is this the wisdom of the East? Is this the primeval
revelation? Even scholars of high reputation joined in the outcry, and
my friends hinted to me that they would not have wasted their life on
such a book.</p>

<p>Now, suppose a geologist had brought to light the bones of a fossil
animal, dating from a period anterior
<span class = "pagenum">353</span>
<a name = "page353" id = "page353"> </a>
to any in which traces of animal life had been discovered before, would
any young lady venture to say by way of criticism, “Yes, these bones are
very curious, but they are not pretty!” Or suppose a new Egyptian statue
had been discovered, belonging to a dynasty hitherto unrepresented by
any statues, would even a school-boy dare to say, “Yes, it is very nice,
but the Venus of Milo is nicer?” Or suppose an old MS. is brought to
Europe, do we find fault with it, because it is not neatly printed? If a
chemist discovers a new element, is he pitied because it is not gold? If
a botanist writes on germs, has he to defend himself, because he does
not write on flowers? Why, it is simply because the Veda is so different
from what it was expected to be, because it is not like the Psalms, not
like Pindar, not like the Bhagavadgîtâ, it is because it stands alone by
itself, and reveals to us the earliest germs of religious thought, such
as they really were; it is because it places before us a language, more
primitive than any we knew before; it is because its poetry is what you
may call savage, uncouth, rude, horrible, it is for that very reason
that it was worth while to dig and dig till the old buried city was
recovered, showing us what man was, what we were, before we had reached
the level of David, the level of Homer, the level of Zoroaster, showing
us the very cradle of our thoughts, our words, and our deeds. <i>I</i>
am not disappointed with the Veda, and I shall conclude my address with
the last verses of the last hymn, which you have now in your
hands,&mdash;verses which thousands of years ago may have been addressed
to a similar meeting of Aryan fellow-men, and which are not

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the “Indian Mirror,” published at
Calcutta, 20 September, 1874, a&nbsp;native writer gave utterance almost
at the same time to the same <span class =
"locked">feelings:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“When the dominion passed from the Mogul to the hands of Englishmen,
the latter regarded the natives as little better than niggers, having a
civilization perhaps a shade better than that of the
barbarians.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The gulf was wide between the
conquerors and the conquered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was no
affection to lessen the distance between the two
races.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The discovery of Sanskrit entirely
revolutionized the course of thought and speculations. It served as the
‘open sesame’ to many hidden treasures. It was then that the position of
India in the scale of civilization was distinctly apprehended. It was
then that our relations with the advanced nations of the world were
fully realized. We were niggers at one time. We now become
brethren.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The advent of the English found us a
nation low sunk in the mire of superstitions, ignorance, and political
servitude. The advent of scholars like Sir William Jones found us fully
established in a rank above that of every nation as that from which
modern civilization could be distinctly traced. It would be interesting
to contemplate what would have been our position if the science of
philology had not been discovered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was only when
the labor of scholars brought to light the treasures of our antiquity
that they perceived how near we were to their races in almost all things
that they held dear in their life. It was then that our claims on their
affection and regard were first established. As Hindus we ought never to
forget the labor of scholars. We owe them our life as a nation, our
freedom as a recognized society, and our position in the scale of races.
It is the fashion with many to decry the labors of those men as dry,
unprofitable, and
<span class = "pagenum">356</span>
<a name = "page356" id = "page356"> </a>
dreamy. We should know that it is to the study of the roots and
inflections of the Sanskrit language that we owe our national
salvation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Within a very few years after the
discovery of Sanskrit, a&nbsp;revolution took place in the history of
comparative science. Never were so many discoveries made at once, and
from the speculations of learned scholars like &mdash;&mdash;, the
dawnings of many truths are even now visible to the
world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Comparative mythology and comparative
religion are new terms altogether in the world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We

scholars.”</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> following letter addressed by me
to the “Academy,” October 17, 1874, p.&nbsp;433, gives the reasons for
this <span class = "locked">statement:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was aware of the mission of the four young Brahmans sent to
Benares in 1845, to copy out and study the four Vedas respectively.
I&nbsp;had read of it last in the ‘Historical Sketch of the Brahmo
Samaj,’ which Miss Collet had the kindness to send me. But what I said
in my address before the Oriental Congress referred to earlier times.
That mission in 1845 was, in fact, the last result of much previous
discussion, which gradually weakened and destroyed in the mind of Ram
Mohun Roy and his followers their traditional faith in the Divine origin
of the Vedas. At first Ram Mohun Roy met the arguments of his English
friends by simply saying, ‘If you claim a Divine origin for your sacred
books, so do we;’ and when he was pressed by the argument derived from
internal evidence, he appealed to a few hymns, such as the Gâyatrî, and
to the Upanishads, as by no means inferior to passages in the Bible, and
not unworthy of a divine author. The Veda with him was chiefly in the
Upanishads, and he had hardly any knowledge of the hymns of the
Rig-Veda. I&nbsp;state this on the authority of a conversation that
passed between him and young Rosen, who was then working at the MSS. of
the Rig-Veda-Sanhitâ in the British Museum, and to whom Ram Mohun Roy
expressed his regret at not being able to read his own sacred books.</p>

<p>“There were other channels, too, through which, after Ram Mohun Roy’s
death in 1833, a&nbsp;knowledge of the studies of European scholars may
have reached the still hesitating reformers
<span class = "pagenum">357</span>
<a name = "page357" id = "page357"> </a>
of the Brahma Sabhá. Dvarka Náth Tagore paid a visit to Europe in the
year 1845. I&nbsp;write from memory. Though not a man of deep religious
feelings, he was an enlightened and shrewd observer of all that passed
before his eyes. He was not a Sanskrit scholar; and I well recollect,
when we paid a visit together to Eugène Burnouf, Dvarka Náth Tagore
putting his dark delicate hand on one side of Burnouf’s edition of the
‘<span class = "sanskrit">Bhagavat Purâṇa</span>,’ containing the French
translation, and saying he could understand that, but not the Sanskrit
original on the opposite page. I&nbsp;saw him frequently at Paris, where
I was then engaged in collecting materials for a complete edition of the
Vedas and the commentary of <span class = "sanskrit">Sâyaṇâcârya</span>.
Many a morning did I pass in his rooms, smoking, accompanying him on the
pianoforte, and discussing questions in which we took a common interest.
I&nbsp;remember one morning, after he had been singing some Italian,
French, and German music, I&nbsp;asked him to sing an Indian song. He
declined at first, saying that he knew I should not like it; but at last
he yielded, and sang, not one of the modern Persian songs, which
commonly go by the name of Indian, but a genuine native piece of music.
I&nbsp;listened quietly, but when it was over, I&nbsp;told him that it
seemed strange to me, how one who could appreciate Italian and German
music could find any pleasure in what sounded to me like mere noise,
without melody, rhythm, or harmony. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘that is exactly like
you Europeans! When I first heard your Italian and German music I
disliked it; it was no music to me at all. But I persevered,
I&nbsp;became accustomed to it, I&nbsp;found out what was good in it,
and now I am able to enjoy it. But you despise whatever is strange to
you, whether in music, or philosophy, or religion; you will not listen
and learn, and we shall understand you much sooner than you will
understand us.’</p>

<p>“In our conversations on the Vedas he never, as far as I recollect,
defended the divine origin of his own sacred writings in the abstract,
but he displayed great casuistic cleverness in maintaining that every
argument that had ever been adduced in support of a supernatural origin
of the Bible could be used with equal force in favor of a divine
authorship of the Veda. His own ideas of the Veda were chiefly derived
from the Upanishads, and he frequently assured me that there was much
more of Vedic literature in India than we imagined. This Dvarka Náth
Tagore was the father of Debendra Náth Tagore, the true founder of
<span class = "pagenum">358</span>
<a name = "page358" id = "page358"> </a>
the Brahmo Samáj, who, in 1845, sent the four young Brahmans to Benares
to copy out and study the four Vedas. Though Dvarka Náth Tagore was so
far orthodox that he maintained a number of Brahmans, yet it was he also
who continued the grant for the support of the Church, founded at
Calcutta by Ram Mohun Roy. One letter written by Dvarka Náth Tagore from
Paris to Calcutta in 1845, would supply the missing link between what
was passing at that time in a room of a hotel on the Place Vendôme, and
the resolution taken at Calcutta to find out, once for all, what the
Vedas really are.</p>

<p>“In India itself the idea of a critical and historical study of the
Veda originated certainly with English scholars. Dr. Mill once showed me
the first attempt at printing the sacred Gâyatrî in Calcutta; and, if I
am not mistaken, he added that unfortunately the gentleman who had
printed it died soon after, thus confirming the prophecies of the
Brahmans that such a sacrilege would not remain unavenged by the gods.
Dr. Mill, Stevenson, Wilson, and others were the first to show to the
educated natives in India that the Upanishads belonged to a later age
than the hymns of the Rig-Veda, and likewise the first to exhibit to Ram
Mohun Roy and his friends the real character of these ancient hymns. On
a mind like Ram Mohun Roy’s the effect was probably much more immediate
than on his followers, so that it took several years before they decided
on sending their commissioners to Benares to report on the Veda and its
real character. Yet that mission was, I&nbsp;believe, the result of a
slow process of attrition produced by the contact between native and
European minds, and as such I wished to present it in my address at the
Oriental Congress.”</p>

LIFE OF COLEBROOKE.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_1" id = "tagVII_1"
href = "#noteVII_1">1</a></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> name and fame of Henry Thomas
Colebrooke are better known in India, France, Germany, Italy&mdash;nay,
even in Russia&mdash;than in his own country. He was born in London on
the 15th of June, 1765; he died in London on the 10th of March, 1837;
and if now, after waiting for thirty-six years, his only surviving son,
Sir Edward Colebrooke, has at last given us a more complete account of
his father’s life, the impulse has come chiefly from Colebrooke’s
admirers abroad, who wished to know what the man had been whose works
they know so well. If Colebrooke had simply been a distinguished, even a
highly distinguished, servant of the East India Company, we could well
understand that, where the historian has so many eminent services to
record, those of Henry Thomas Colebrooke should have been allowed to
pass almost unnoticed. The history of British India has still to be
written, and it will be no easy task to write it. Macaulay’s “Lives” of
Clive and Warren Hastings are but two specimens to show how it ought to
be, and yet how it cannot be, written. There is in the annals of the
conquest and administrative tenure of India so much of the bold
generalship of raw recruits, the statesmanship of common
<span class = "pagenum">360</span>
<a name = "page360" id = "page360"> </a>
clerks, and the heroic devotion of mere adventurers, that even the
largest canvas of the historian must dwarf the stature of heroes; and
characters which, in the history of Greece or England, would stand out
in bold relief, must vanish unnoticed in the crowd. The substance of the
present memoir appeared in the “Journal” of the Royal Asiatic Society
soon after Mr. Colebrooke’s death. It consisted originally of a brief
notice of his public and literary career, interspersed with extracts
from his letters to his family during the first twenty years of
residence in India. Being asked a few years since to allow this notice
to appear in a new edition of his “Miscellaneous Essays,” which Mr.
Fitz-Edward Hall desired to republish, Sir Edward thought it incumbent
on him to render it more worthy of his father’s reputation. The letters
in the present volume are, for the most part, given in full; and some
additional correspondence is included in it, besides a few papers of
literary interest, and a journal kept by him during his residence at
Nagpur, which was left incomplete. Two addresses delivered to the Royal
Asiatic and Astronomical Societies, and the narrative of a journey to
and from the capital of Berar, are given in an appendix and complete the
volume, which is now on the eve of publication.</p>

<p>Although, as we shall see, the career of Mr. Colebrooke, as a servant
of the East India Company, was highly distinguished, and in its
vicissitudes, as here told by his son, both interesting and instructive,
yet his most lasting fame will not be that of the able administrator,
the learned lawyer, the thoughtful financier and politician, but that of
the founder and father of true Sanskrit scholarship in Europe. In
<span class = "pagenum">361</span>
<a name = "page361" id = "page361"> </a>
that character Colebrooke has secured his place in the history of the
world, a&nbsp;place which neither envy nor ignorance can ever take from
him. Had he lived in Germany, we should long ago have seen his statue in
his native place, his name written in letters of gold on the walls of
academies; we should have heard of Colebrooke jubilees and Colebrooke
scholarships. In England, if any notice is taken of the discovery of
Sanskrit&mdash;a discovery in many respects equally important, in some
even more important, than the revival of Greek scholarship in the
fifteenth century&mdash;we may possibly hear the popular name of Sir
William Jones and his classical translation of Sakuntala; but of the
infinitely more important achievements of Colebrooke, not one word. The
fact is, the time has not yet come when the full importance of the
Sanskrit philology can be appreciated by the public at large. It was the
same with Greek philology. When Greek began to be studied by some of the
leading spirits in Europe, the subject seemed at first one of purely
literary curiosity. When its claims were pressed on the public, they
were met by opposition, and even ridicule; and those who knew least of
Greek were most eloquent in their denunciations. Even when its study had
become more general, and been introduced at universities and schools, it
remained in the eyes of many a mere accomplishment&mdash;its true value
for higher than scholastic purposes being scarcely suspected. At present
we know that the revival of Greek scholarship affected the deepest
interests of humanity, that it was in reality a revival of that
consciousness which links large portions of mankind together, connects
the living with the dead, and thus secures to each
<span class = "pagenum">362</span>
<a name = "page362" id = "page362"> </a>
generation the full intellectual inheritance of our race. Without that
historical consciousness the life of man would be ephemeral and vain.
The more we can see backward, and place ourselves in real sympathy with
the past, the more truly do we make the life of former generations our
own, and are able to fulfill our own appointed duty in carrying on the
work which was begun centuries ago in Athens and at Rome. But while the
unbroken traditions of the Roman world, and the revival of Greek culture
among us, restored to us the intellectual patrimony of Greece and Rome
only, and made the Teutonic race in a certain sense Greek and Roman, the
discovery of Sanskrit will have a much larger influence. Like a new
intellectual spring, it is meant to revive the broken fibres that once
united the Southeastern with the Northwestern branches of the Aryan
family; and thus to rëestablish the spiritual brotherhood, not only of
the Teutonic, Greek, and Roman, but likewise of the Slavonic, Celtic,
Indian, and Persian branches. It is to make the mind of man wider, his
heart larger, his sympathies world-embracing; it is to make us truly
<i>humaniores</i>, richer and prouder in the full perception of what
humanity has been, and what it is meant to be. This is the real object
of the more comprehensive studies of the nineteenth century, and though
the full appreciation of this their true import may be reserved to the
future, no one who follows the intellectual progress of mankind
attentively can fail to see that, even now, the comparative study of
languages, mythologies, and religions has widened our horizon; that much
which was lost has been regained; and that a new world, if it has not

<a name = "page363" id = "page363"> </a>
is curious to observe that those to whom we chiefly owe the discovery of
Sanskrit were as little conscious of the real importance of their
discovery as Columbus was when he landed at St. Salvador. What Mr.
Colebrooke did, was done from a sense of duty, rather than from literary
curiosity; but there was also a tinge of enthusiasm in his character,
like that which carries a traveller to the wastes of Africa or the
icebound regions of the Pole. Whenever there was work ready for him, he
was ready for the work. But he had no theories to substantiate, no
preconceived objects to attain. Sobriety and thoroughness are the
distinguishing features of all his works. There is in them no trace of
haste or carelessness; but neither is there evidence of any
extraordinary effort, or minute professional scholarship. In the same
business-like spirit in which he collected the revenue of his province
he collected his knowledge of Sanskrit literature; with the same
judicial impartiality with which he delivered his judgments he delivered
the results at which he had arrived after his extensive and careful
reading; and with the same sense of confidence with which he quietly
waited for the effects of his political and financial measures, in spite
of the apathy or the opposition with which they met at first, he left
his written works to the judgment of posterity, never wasting his time
in the repeated assertion of his opinions, or in useless controversy,
though he was by no means insensible to his own literary reputation. The
biography of such a man deserves a careful study; and we think that Sir
Edward Colebrooke has fulfilled more than a purely filial duty in giving
to the world a full account of the private, public, and literary life of
his great father.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">364</span>
<a name = "page364" id = "page364"> </a>
<p>Colebrooke was the son of a wealthy London banker, Sir George
Colebrooke, a&nbsp;Member of Parliament, and a man in his time of some
political importance. Having proved himself a successful advocate of the
old privileges of the East India Company, he was invited to join the
Court of Directors, and became in 1769 chairman of the Company. His
chairmanship was distinguished in history by the appointment of Warren
Hastings to the highest office in India, and there are in existence
letters from that illustrious man to Sir George, written in the crisis
of his Indian Administration, which show the intimate and confidential
relations subsisting between them. But when, in later years, Sir George
Colebrooke became involved in pecuniary difficulties, and Indian
appointments were successively obtained for his two sons, James Edward
and Henry Thomas, it does not appear that Warren Hastings took any
active steps to advance them, beyond appointing the elder brother to an
office of some importance on his secretariat. Henry, the younger
brother, had been educated at home, and at the age of fifteen he had
laid a solid foundation in Latin, Greek, French, and particularly in
mathematics. As he never seems to have been urged on, he learned what he
learned quietly and thoroughly, trying from the first to satisfy himself
rather than others. Thus a love of knowledge for its own sake remained
firmly engrained in his mind through life, and explains much of what
would otherwise remain inexplicable in his literary career.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen he started for India, and arrived at Madras in
1783, having narrowly escaped capture by French cruisers. The times were
anxious times for India, and full of interest to an observer of
<span class = "pagenum">365</span>
<a name = "page365" id = "page365"> </a>
political events. In his very first letter from India Colebrooke thus
sketches the political situation:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“The state of affairs in India seems to bear a far more favorable aspect
than for a long time past. The peace with the Mahrattas and the death of
Hyder Ally, the intended invasion of Tippoo’s country by the Mahrattas,
sufficiently removed all alarm from the country powers; but there are
likewise accounts arrived, and which seem to be credited, of the defeat
of Tippoo by Colonel Matthews, who commands on the other coast.”</p>

<p>From Madras Colebrooke proceeded, in 1783, to Calcutta, where he met
his elder brother, already established in the service. His own start in
official life was delayed, and took place under circumstances by no
means auspicious. The tone, both in political and private life, was at
that time at its lowest ebb in India. Drinking, gambling, and
extravagance of all kinds were tolerated even in the best society, and
Colebrooke could not entirely escape the evil effects of the moral
atmosphere in which he had to live. It is all the more remarkable that
his taste for work never deserted him, and “that he would retire to his
midnight Sanskrit studies unaffected by the excitement of the
gambling-table.” It was not till 1786&mdash;a year after Warren Hastings
had left India&mdash;that he received his first official appointment, as
Assistant Collector of Revenue in Tirhut. His father seems to have
advised him from the first to be assiduous in acquiring the vernacular
languages, and we find him at an early period of his Indian career thus
writing on this subject: “The one, and that the most necessary, Moors
(now called Hindustani), by not being written, bars all close
application; the other, Persian, is too dry to entice, and is so seldom
of any use, that I seek its acquisition very leisurely.” He asked his
father
<span class = "pagenum">366</span>
<a name = "page366" id = "page366"> </a>
in turn to send him the Greek and Latin classics, evidently intending to
carry on his old favorite studies, rather than begin a new career as an
Oriental scholar. For a time he seemed, indeed, deeply disappointed with
his life in India, and his prospects were anything but encouraging. But
although he seriously thought of throwing up his position and returning
to England, he was busy nevertheless in elaborating a scheme for the
better regulation of the Indian service. His chief idea was, that the
three functions of the civil service&mdash;the commercial, the revenue,
and the diplomatic&mdash;should be separated; that each branch should be
presided over by an independent board, and that those who had qualified
themselves for one branch should not be transferred to another.
Curiously enough, he lived to prove by his own example the applicability
of the old system, being himself transferred from the revenue department
to a judgeship, then employed on an important diplomatic mission, and
lastly raised to a seat in Council, and acquitting himself well in each
of these different employments. After a time his discontent seems to
have vanished. He quietly settled down to his work in collecting the
revenue of Tirhut; and his official duties soon became so absorbing,
that he found little time for projecting reforms of the Indian Civil
Service.</p>

<p>Soon also his Oriental studies gave him a new interest in the country
and the people. The first allusions to Oriental literature occur in a
letter dated Patna, December 10, 1786. It is addressed to his father,
who had desired some information concerning the religion of the Hindus.
Colebrooke’s own interest in Sanskrit literature was from the first
scientific rather than literary. His love of mathematics and
<span class = "pagenum">367</span>
<a name = "page367" id = "page367"> </a>
astronomy made him anxious to find out what the Brahmans had achieved in
these branches of knowledge. It is surprising to see how correct is the
first communication which he sends to his father on the four modes of
reckoning time adopted by Hindu astronomers, and which he seems chiefly
to have drawn from Persian sources. The passage (pp.&nbsp;23&ndash;26)
is too long to be given here, but we recommend it to the careful
attention of Sanskrit scholars, who will find it more accurate than what
has but lately been written on the same subject. Colebrooke treated,
again, of the different measures of time in his essay “On Indian Weights
and Measures,” published in the “Asiatic Researches,” 1798; and in
stating the rule for finding the planets which preside over the day,
called <i>Horâ</i>, he was the first to point out the coincidence
between that expression and our name for the twenty-fourth part of the
day. In one of the notes to his Dissertation on the Algebra of the
Hindus he showed that this and other astrological terms were evidently
borrowed by the Hindus from the Greeks, or other external sources; and
in a manuscript note published for the first time by Sir
E.&nbsp;Colebrooke, we find him following up the same subject, and
calling attention to the fact that the word <i>Horâ</i> occurs in the
Sanskrit vocabulary&mdash;the <i>Medinî-Kosha</i>, and bears there,
among other significations, that of the rising of a sign of the zodiac,
or half a sign. This, as he remarks, is in diurnal motion one
<i>hour</i>, thus confirming the connection between the Indian and
European significations of the word.</p>

<p>While he thus felt attracted towards the study of Oriental literature
by his own scientific interests, it seems that Sanskrit literature and
poetry by themselves
<span class = "pagenum">368</span>
<a name = "page368" id = "page368"> </a>
had no charms for him. On the contrary, he declares himself repelled by
the false taste of Oriental writers; and he speaks very slightingly of
“the <i>amateurs</i> who do not seek the acquisition of useful
knowledge, but would only wish to attract notice, without the labor of
deserving it, which is readily accomplished by an ode from the Persian,
an apologue from the Sanskrit, or a song from some unheard-of dialect of
Hinduee, of which <i>amateur</i> favors the public with a <i>free</i>
translation, without understanding the original, as you will immediately
be convinced, if you peruse that repository of nonsense, the ‘Asiatic
Miscellany.’” He makes one exception, however, in favor of Wilkins.
“I&nbsp;have never yet seen any book,” he writes, “which can be depended
on for information concerning the real opinions of the Hindus, except
Wilkins’s ‘Bhagvat Geeta.’ That gentleman was Sanskrit mad, and has more
materials and more general knowledge respecting the Hindus than any
other foreigner ever acquired since the days of Pythagoras.” Arabic,
too, did not then find much more favor in his eyes than Sanskrit. “Thus
much,” he writes, “I&nbsp;am induced to believe, that the Arabic
language is of more difficult acquisition than Latin, or even than
Greek; and, although it may be concise and nervous, it will not reward
the labor of the student, since, in the works of science, he can find
nothing new, and, in those of literature, he could not avoid feeling his
judgment offended by the false taste in which they are written, and his
imagination being heated by the glow of their imagery. A&nbsp;few dry
facts might, however, reward the literary
drudge.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>It may be doubted, indeed, whether Colebrooke would ever have
overcome these prejudices, had it
<span class = "pagenum">369</span>
<a name = "page369" id = "page369"> </a>
not been for his father’s exhortations. In 1789, Colebrooke was
transferred from Tirhut to Purneah; and such was his interest in his new
and more responsible office, that, according to his own expression, he
felt for it all the solicitude of a young author. Engrossed in his work,
a&nbsp;ten years’ settlement of some of the districts of his new
collectorship, he writes to his father in July, 1790:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“The religion, manners, natural history, traditions, and arts of this
country may, certainly, furnish subjects on which my communications
might, perhaps, be not uninteresting; but to offer anything deserving of
attention would require a season of leisure to collect and digest
information. Engaged in public and busy scenes, my mind is wholly
engrossed by the cares and duties of my station; in vain I seek, for
relaxation’s sake, to direct my thoughts to other subjects; matters of
business constantly recur. It is for this cause that I have occasionally
apologized for a dearth of subjects, having no occurrences to relate,
and the matters which occupy my attention being uninteresting as a
subject of correspondence.”</p>

<p>When, after a time, the hope of distinguishing himself impelled
Colebrooke to new exertions, and he determined to become an author, the
subject which he chose was not antiquarian or philosophical, but purely
practical.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Translations,” he writes, in 1790, “are for those who rather need to
fill their purses than gratify their ambition. For original compositions
on Oriental history and sciences is required more reading in the
literature of the East than I possess, or am likely to attain. My
subject should be connected with those matters to which my attention is
professionally led. One subject is, I&nbsp;believe, yet
untouched&mdash;the agriculture of Bengal. On this I have been curious
of information; and, having obtained some, I&nbsp;am now pursuing
inquiries with some degree of regularity. I&nbsp;wish for your opinion,
whether it would be worth while to reduce into form the information
which may be
<span class = "pagenum">370</span>
<a name = "page370" id = "page370"> </a>
obtained on a subject necessarily dry, and which (curious, perhaps) is,
certainly, useless to English readers.”</p>

<p>Among the subjects of which he wishes to treat in this work we find
some of antiquarian interest, <i>e.g.</i>, what castes of Hindus <ins
class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: ‘altogether forbid’ or ‘are altogether forbidden (to cultivate)’">are altogether forbid</ins>
cultivating, and what castes have religious prejudices against the
culture of particular articles. Others are purely technical; for
instance, the question of the succession and mixture of crops. He states
that the Hindus have some traditional maxims on the succession of crops
to which they rigidly adhere; and with regard to mixture, he observes
that two, three, or even four different articles are sown in the same
field, and gathered successively, as they ripen; that they are sometimes
all sown on the same day, sometimes at different periods, etc.</p>

<p>His letters now became more and more interesting, and they generally
contain some fragments which show us how the sphere of his inquiries
became more and more extended. We find (p.&nbsp;39) observations on the
Psylli of Egypt and the snake-charmers of India, on the Sikhs
(p.&nbsp;45), on human sacrifices in India (p.&nbsp;46). The spirit of
inquiry which had been kindled by Sir W. Jones, more particularly since
the foundation of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784, had evidently
reached Colebrooke. It is difficult to fix the exact date when he began
the study of Sanskrit. He seems to have taken it up and left it again in
despair several times. In 1793 he was removed from Purneah to Nattore.
From that place he sent to his father the first volumes of the “Asiatic
Researches,” published by the members of the Asiatic Society. He drew
his father’s attention to some articles in them, which would seem to
prove that the
<span class = "pagenum">371</span>
<a name = "page371" id = "page371"> </a>
ancient Hindus possessed a knowledge of Egypt and of the Jews, but he
adds: “No historical light can be expected from Sanskrit literature; but
it may, nevertheless, be curious, if not useful, to publish such of
their legends as seem to resemble others known to European mythology.”
The first glimmering of comparative mythology in 1793!</p>

<p>Again he writes in 1793, “In my Sanskrit studies, I do not confine
myself now to particular subjects, but skim the surface of all their
sciences. I&nbsp;will subjoin, for your amusement, some remarks on
subjects treated in the ‘Researches.’”</p>

<p>What the results of that skimming were, and how far more
philosophical his appreciation of Hindu literature had then become, may
be seen from the end of the same letter, written from Rajshahi,
December, 6, 1793:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Upon the whole, whatever may be the true antiquity of this nation,
whether their mythology be a corruption of the pure deism we find in
their books, or their deism a refinement from gross idolatry; whether
their religious and moral precepts have been engrafted on the elegant
philosophy of the Nyâya and Mimânsâ, or this philosophy been refined on
the plainer text of the Veda; the Hindu is the most ancient nation of
which we have valuable remains, and has been surpassed by none in
refinement and civilization; though the utmost pitch of refinement to
which it ever arrived preceded, in time, the dawn of civilization in any
other nation of which we have even the name in history. The further our
literary inquiries are extended here, the more vast and stupendous is
the scene which opens to us; at the same time, that the true and false,
the sublime and the puerile, wisdom and absurdity, are so intermixed,
that, at every step, we have to smile at folly, while we admire and
acknowledge the philosophical truth, though couched in obscure allegory
and puerile fable<ins class = "correction" title = "” missing">.”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>In 1794, Colebrooke presented to the Asiatic
<span class = "pagenum">372</span>
<a name = "page372" id = "page372"> </a>
Society his first paper, “On the Duties of a Faithful Hindu Widow,” and
he told his father at the same time, that he meant to pursue his
Sanskrit inquiries diligently, and in a spirit which seems to have
guided all his work through life: “The only caution,” he says, “which
occurs to me is, not to hazard in publication anything crude or
imperfect, which would injure my reputation as a man of letters; to
avoid this, the precaution may be taken of submitting my manuscripts to
private perusal.”</p>

<p>Colebrooke might indeed from that time have become altogether devoted
to the study of Sanskrit, had not his political feelings been strongly
roused by the new Charter of the East India Company, which, instead of
sanctioning reforms long demanded by political economists, confirmed
nearly all the old privileges of their trade. Colebrooke was a
free-trader by conviction, and because he had at heart the interests
both of India and of England. It is quite gratifying to find a man,
generally so cold and prudent as Colebrooke, warm with indignation at
the folly and injustice of the policy carried out by England with regard
to her Indian subjects. He knew very well that it was personally
dangerous for a covenanted servant to discuss and attack the privileges
of the Company, but he felt that he ought to think and act, not merely
as the servant of a commercial company, but as the servant of the
British Government. He wished, even at that early time, that India
should become an integral portion of the British Empire, and cease to
be, as soon as possible, a&nbsp;mere appendage, yielding a large
commercial revenue. He was encouraged in these views by Mr. Anthony
Lambert, and the two friends at last decided to embody their
<span class = "pagenum">373</span>
<a name = "page373" id = "page373"> </a>
views in a work, which they privately printed, under the title of
“Remarks on the Present State of the Husbandry and Commerce of Bengal.”
Colebrooke, as we know, had paid considerable attention to the subject
of husbandry, and he now contributed much of the material which he had
collected for a purely didactic work, to this controversial and
political treatise. He is likewise responsible, and he never tried to
shirk that responsibility, for most of the advanced financial theories
which it contains. The volume was sent to England, and submitted to the
Prime Minister of the day and several other persons of influence. It
seems to have produced an impression in the quarters most concerned, but
it was considered prudent to stop its further circulation on account of
the dangerous free-trade principles, which it supported with powerful
arguments. Colebrooke had left the discretion of publishing the work in
England to his friends, and he cheerfully submitted to their decision.
He himself, however, never ceased to advocate the most liberal financial
opinions, and being considered by those in power in Leadenhall Street as
a dangerous young man, his advancement in India became slower than it
would otherwise have been.</p>

<p>A man of Colebrooke’s power, however, was too useful to the Indian
Government to be passed over altogether, and though his career was
neither rapid nor brilliant, it was nevertheless most successful. Just
at the time when Sir W. Jones had died suddenly, Colebrooke was removed
from the revenue to the judicial branch of the Indian service, and there
was no man in India, except Colebrooke, who could carry on the work
which Sir W. Jones had left unfinished, viz.: “The Digest of Hindu and
Mohammedan
<span class = "pagenum">374</span>
<a name = "page374" id = "page374"> </a>
Laws.” At the instance of Warren Hastings, a&nbsp;clause had been
inserted in the Act of 1772, providing that “Maulavies and Pundits
should attend the Courts, to expound the law and assist in passing the
decrees.” In all suits regarding inheritance, marriage, caste, and
religious usages and institutions, the ancient laws of the Hindus were
to be followed, and for that purpose a body of laws from their own books
had to be compiled. Under the direction of Warren Hastings, nine
Brahmans had been commissioned to draw up a code, which appeared in
1776, under the title of “Code of Gentoo Laws.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_2" id = "tagVII_2" href = "#noteVII_2">2</a> It had been
originally compiled in Sanskrit, then translated into Persian, and from
that into English. As that code, however, was very imperfect, Sir W.
Jones had urged on the Government the necessity of a more complete and
authentic compilation. Texts were to be collected, after the model of
Justinian’s Pandects, from law-books of approved authority, and to be
digested according to a scientific analysis, with references to original
authors. The task of arranging the text-books and compiling the new code
fell chiefly to a learned Pandit, Jagannâtha, and the task of
translating it was now, after the death of Sir W. Jones, undertaken by
Colebrooke. This task was no easy one, and could hardly be carried out
without the help of really learned pandits. Fortunately Colebrooke was
removed at the time when he undertook this work, to Mirzapur, close to
Benares, the seat of Brahmanical learning, in the north of India, and
the seat of a Hindu College. Here Colebrooke found not
<span class = "pagenum">375</span>
<a name = "page375" id = "page375"> </a>
only rich collections of Sanskrit MSS, but likewise a number of law
pandits, who could solve many of the difficulties which he had to
encounter in the translation of Jagannâtha’s Digest. After two years of
incessant labor, we find Colebrooke on <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘Jannary’">January</ins> 3, 1797, announcing the completion
of his task, which at once established his position as the best Sanskrit
scholar of the day. Oriental studies were at that time in the ascendant
in India. A&nbsp;dictionary was being compiled, and several grammars
were in preparation. Types also had been cut, and for the first time
Sanskrit texts issued from the press in Devanâgarî letters. Native
scholars, too, began to feel a pride in the revival of their ancient
literature. The Brahmans, as Colebrooke writes, were by no means averse
to instruct strangers; they did not even conceal from him the most
sacred texts of the Veda. Colebrooke’s “Essays on the Religious
Ceremonies of the Hindus,” which appeared in the fifth volume of the
“Asiatic Researches” in the same year as his translation of the
“Digest,” show very clearly that he had found excellent instructors, and
had been initiated in the most sacred literature of the Brahmans. An
important paper on the Hindu schools of law seems to date from the same
period, and shows a familiarity, not only with the legal authorities of
India, but with the whole structure of the traditional and sacred
literature of the Brahmans, which but few Sanskrit scholars could lay
claim to even at the present day. In the fifth volume of the “Asiatic
Researches” appeared also his essay “On Indian Weights and Measures,”
and his “Enumeration of Indian Classes.” A&nbsp;short, but thoughtful
memorandum on the origin of caste, written during that period, and
<span class = "pagenum">376</span>
<a name = "page376" id = "page376"> </a>
printed for the first time in his “Life,” will be read with interest by
all who are acquainted with the different views of living scholars on
this important subject.</p>

<p>Colebrooke’s idea was that the institution of caste was not <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘artifical’">artificial</ins>
or conventional, but that it began with the simple division of freemen
and slaves, which we find among all ancient nations. This division, as
he supposes, existed among the Hindus before they settled in India. It
became positive law after their emigration from the northern mountains
into India, and was there adapted to the new state of the Hindus,
settled among the aborigines. The class of slaves or <em>Śûdras</em>
consisted of those who came into India in that degraded state, and those
of the aborigines who submitted and were spared. Menial offices and
mechanical labor were deemed unworthy of freemen in other countries
besides India, and it cannot therefore appear strange that the class of
the <em>Śûdras</em> comprehended in India both servants and mechanics,
both Hindus and emancipated aborigines. The class of freemen included
originally the priest, the soldier, the merchant, and the husbandman. It
was divided into three orders, the <em class =
"sanskrit">Brâhmaṇas</em>, <em>Kshatriyas</em>, and <em>Vaiśyas</em>,
the last comprehending merchants and husbandmen indiscriminately, being
the yeomen of the country and the citizens of the town. According to
Colebrooke’s opinion, the <em>Kshatriyas</em> consisted originally of
kings and their descendants. It was the order of princes, rather than of
mere soldiers. The <em class = "sanskrit">Brâhmaṇas</em> comprehended no
more than the descendants of a few religious men who, by superior
knowledge and the austerity of their lives, had gained an <ins class =
"correction" title = "spelling unchanged">ascendency</ins> over the
<span class = "pagenum">377</span>
<a name = "page377" id = "page377"> </a>
people. Neither of these orders was originally very numerous, and their
prominence gave no offense to the far more powerful body of the citizens
and yeomen.</p>

<p>When legislators began to give their sanction to this social system,
their chief object seems to have been to guard against too great a
confusion of the four orders&mdash;the two orders of nobility, the
sacerdotal and the princely, and the two orders of the people, the
citizens and the slaves, by either prohibiting intermarriage, or by
degrading the offspring of alliances between members of different
orders. If men of superior married women of inferior, but next
adjoining, rank, the offspring of their marriage sank to the rank of
their mothers, or obtained a position intermediate between the two. The
children of such marriages were distinguished by separate titles. Thus,
the son of a <em class = "sanskrit">Brâhmaṇa</em> by a
<em>Kshatriya</em> woman was called <em>Mûrdhâbhishikta</em>, which
implies royalty. They formed a distinct tribe of princes or military
nobility, and were by some reckoned superior to the <em>Kshatriya</em>.
The son of a <em class = "sanskrit">Brâhmaṇa</em> by a <em>Vaiśya</em>
woman was a <em>Vaidya</em> or <em class = "sanskrit">Ambashṭha</em>;
the offspring of a <em>Kshatriya</em> by a <em>Vaisya</em> was a
<em>Mahishya</em>, forming two tribes of respectable citizens. But if a
greater disproportion of rank existed between the parents&mdash;if, for
instance, a&nbsp;<em class = "sanskrit">Brâhmaṇa</em> married a
<em>Śûdra</em>, the offspring of their marriage, the <em>Nishâda</em>,
suffered greater social penalties; he became impure, notwithstanding the
nobility of his father. Marriages, again, between women of superior with
men of inferior rank were considered more objectionable than marriages
of men of superior with women of inferior rank, a&nbsp;sentiment which
continues to the present day.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">378</span>
<a name = "page378" id = "page378"> </a>
<p>What is peculiar to the social system, as sanctioned by Hindu
legislators, and gives it its artificial character, is their attempt to
provide by minute regulations for the rank to be assigned to new tribes,
and to point out professions suitable to that rank. The tribes had each
an internal government, and professions naturally formed themselves into
companies. From this source, while the corporations imitated the
regulations of tribes, a&nbsp;multitude of new and arbitrary tribes
sprang up, the origin of which, as assigned by Manu and other
legislators, was probably, as Colebrooke admits, more or less
fanciful.</p>

<p>In his “Remarks on the Husbandry and Internal Commerce of Bengal,”
the subject of caste in its bearing on the social improvement of the
Indian nation was likewise treated by Colebrooke. In reply to the
erroneous views then prevalent as to the supposed barriers which caste
placed against the free development of the Hindus, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“An erroneous doctrine has been started, as if the great population of
these provinces could not avail to effect improvements, notwithstanding
opportunities afforded by an increased demand for particular
manufactures or for raw produce: because, ‘professions are hereditary
among the Hindus; the offspring of men of one calling do not intrude
into any other; professions are confined to hereditary descent; and the
produce of any particular manufacture cannot be extended according to
the increase of the demand, but must depend upon the population of the
caste, or tribe, which works on that manufacture; or, in other words, if
the demand for any article should exceed the ability of the number of
workmen who produce it, the deficiency cannot be supplied by calling in
assistance from other tribes.’</p>

<p class = "quote">
“In opposition to this unfounded opinion, it is necessary that we not
only show, as has been already done, that the population is actually
sufficient for great improvement, but we must also prove, that
professions are not separated by an impassable line, and that the
population affords a sufficient number whose

“The Muselmans, to whom the argument above quoted cannot in any manner
be applied, bear no inconsiderable proportion to the whole population.
Other descriptions of people, not governed by Hindu institutions, are
found among the inhabitants of these provinces; in regard to these,
also, the objection is irrelevant. The Hindus themselves, to whom the
doctrine which we combat is meant to be applied, cannot exceed nine
tenths of the population; probably, they do not bear so great a
proportion to the other tribes. They are, as is well known, divided into
four grand classes; but the three first of them are much less numerous
than the <em>Śûdra</em>. The aggregate of <em class =

amount, at the most, to a fifth of the population; and even these are
not absolutely restricted to their own appointed occupations<ins class =

universally permitted; and, under the designation of servants of the

“In this tribe are included not only the true <em>Śûdras</em>, but also
the several castes whose origin is ascribed to the promiscuous
intercourse of the four classes. To these, also, their several
occupations were assigned; but neither are they restricted, by rigorous
injunctions, to their own appointed occupations. For any person unable
to procure a subsistence by the exercise of his own profession may earn
a livelihood in the calling of a subordinate caste, within certain
limits in the scale of relative precedence assigned to each; and no
forfeiture is now incurred by his intruding into a superior profession.
It was, indeed, the duty of the Hindu magistrate to restrain the
encroachments of inferior tribes on the occupations of superior castes;
but, under a foreign government, this restraint has no existence.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“In practice, little attention is paid to the limitations to which we
have here alluded: daily observation shows even Brâhmanas exercising the
menial profession of a Sûdra. We are aware that every caste forms itself
into clubs, or lodges, consisting of the several individuals of that
caste residing within a small distance; and that these clubs, or lodges,
govern themselves by particular rules and customs, or by laws. But,
though some restrictions and limitations, not founded on religious
prejudices,

are found among their by-laws, it may be received, as a general maxim,
that the occupation appointed for each tribe is entitled merely to a
preference. Every profession, with few exceptions, is open to every
description of persons, and the discouragement arising from religious
prejudices is not greater than what exists in Great Britain from the
effects of municipal and corporation laws. In Bengal, the numbers of
people actually willing to apply to any particular occupation are
sufficient for the unlimited extension of any manufacture.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“If these facts and observations be not considered as a conclusive
refutation of the unfounded assertion made on this subject, we must
appeal to the experience of every gentleman who may have resided in the
provinces of Bengal, whether a change of occupation and profession does
not frequently and indefinitely occur? Whether Brâhmanas are not
employed in the most servile offices? And whether the Sûdra is not seen
elevated to situations of respectability and importance? In short,
whether the assertion above quoted be not altogether destitute of
foundation?”</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that studies so auspiciously begun were
suddenly interrupted by a diplomatic mission, which called Colebrooke
away from Mirzapur, and retained him from 1798 to 1801 at Nagpur, the
capital of Berar. Colebrooke himself had by this time discovered that,
however distinguished his public career might be, his lasting fame must
depend on his Sanskrit studies. We find him even at Nagpur continuing
his literary work, particularly the compilation and translation of a
Supplementary Digest. He also prepared, as far as this was possible in
the midst of diplomatic avocations, some of his most important
contributions to the “Asiatic Researches,” one on Sanskrit prosody,
which did not appear till 1808, and was then styled an essay on Sanskrit
and Prakrit poetry; one on the Vedas, another on Indian Theogonies (not
published), and a critical treatise on Indian plants. At last, in May,
1801, he left Nagpur to
<span class = "pagenum">381</span>
<a name = "page381" id = "page381"> </a>
return to his post at Mirzapur. Shortly afterwards he was summoned to
Calcutta, and appointed a member of the newly constituted Court of
Appeal. He at the same time accepted the honorary post of Professor of
Sanskrit at the college recently established at Fort William, without,
however, taking an active part in the teaching of pupils. He seems to
have been a director of studies rather than an actual professor, but he
rendered valuable service as examiner in Sanskrit, Bengali, Hindustani,
and Persian<ins class = "correction" title = "text has , for .">.
</ins>In 1801 appeared his essay on the Sanskrit and Prakrit languages,
which shows how well he had qualified himself to act as professor of
Sanskrit, and how well, in addition to the legal and sacred literature
of the Brahmans, he had mastered the <i>belles lettres</i> of India
also, which at first, as we saw, had rather repelled him by their
extravagance and want of taste.</p>

<p>And here we have to take note of a fact which has never been
mentioned in the history of the science of language, viz., that
Colebrooke at that early time devoted considerable attention to the
study of Comparative Philology. To judge from his papers, which have
never been published, but which are still in the possession of Sir E.
Colebrooke, the range of his comparisons was very wide, and embraced not
only Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, with their derivatives, but also the
Germanic and Slavonic languages.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_3" id =
"tagVII_3" href = "#noteVII_3">3</a></p>

<p>The principal work, however, of this period of his life was his
Sanskrit Grammar. Though it was never finished, it will always keep its
place, like a classical <i>torso</i>, more admired in its unfinished
state than other works which stand by its side; finished, yet less
perfect. Sir E. Colebrooke has endeavored to convey to
<span class = "pagenum">382</span>
<a name = "page382" id = "page382"> </a>
the general reader some idea of the difficulties which had to be
overcome by those who, for the first time, approached the study of the
native grammarians, particularly of Pâṇini. But this grammatical
literature, the 3,996 grammatical <i>sûtras</i> or rules, which
determine every possible form of the Sanskrit language in a manner
unthought of by the grammarians of any other country, the glosses and
commentaries, one piled upon the other, which are indispensable for a
successful unraveling of Pâṇini’s artful web, which start every
objection, reasonable or unreasonable, that can be imagined, either
against Pâṇini himself or against his interpreters, which establish
general principles, register every exception, and defend all forms
apparently anomalous of the ancient Vedic language; all this together is
so completely <i>sui generis</i>, that those only who have themselves
followed Colebrooke’s footsteps can appreciate the boldness of the first
adventurer, and the perseverance of the first explorer of that
grammatical labyrinth. Colebrooke’s own Grammar of the Sanskrit
language, founded on works of native grammarians, has sometimes been
accused of obscurity, nor can it be denied that for those who wish to
acquire the elements of the language, it is almost useless. But those
who know the materials which Colebrooke worked up in his grammar, will
readily give him credit for what he has done in bringing the
<i>indigesta moles</i> which he found before him into something like
order. He made the first step, and a very considerable step it was, in
translating the strange phraseology of Sanskrit grammarians into
something at least intelligible to European scholars. How it could have
been imagined that their extraordinary grammatical phraseology was
borrowed by the Hindus
<span class = "pagenum">383</span>
<a name = "page383" id = "page383"> </a>
from the Greeks, or that its formation was influenced by the grammatical
schools established among the Greeks in Bactria, is difficult to
understand, if one possesses but the slightest acquaintance with the
character of either system, or with their respective historical
developments. It would be far more accurate to say that the Indian and
Greek systems of grammar represent two opposite poles, exhibiting the
two starting-points from which alone the grammar of a language can be
attacked, viz., the theoretical and the empirical. Greek grammar begins
with philosophy, and forces language into the categories established by
logic. Indian grammar begins with a mere collection of facts,
systematizes them mechanically, and thus leads in the end to a system
which, though marvelous for its completeness and perfection, is
nevertheless, from a higher point of view, a&nbsp;mere triumph of
scholastic pedantry.</p>

<p>Colebrooke’s grammar, even in its unfinished state, will always be
the best introduction to a study of the native grammarians&mdash;a study
indispensable to every sound Sanskrit scholar. In accuracy of statement
it still holds the first place among European grammars, and it is only
to be regretted that the references to Pânini and other grammatical
authorities, which existed in Colebrooke’s manuscript, should have been
left out when it came to be printed. The modern school of Sanskrit
students has entirely reverted to Colebrooke’s views on the importance
of a study of the native grammarians. It is no longer considered
sufficient to know the correct forms of Sanskrit declension or
conjugation: if challenged, we must be prepared to substantiate their
correctness by giving chapter and verse from Pâṇini, the fountain-head
of
<span class = "pagenum">384</span>
<a name = "page384" id = "page384"> </a>
Indian grammar. If Sir E. Colebrooke says that “Bopp also drew deeply
from the fountain-head of Indian grammar in his subsequent labors,” he
has been misinformed. Bopp may have changed his opinion that “the
student might arrive at a critical knowledge of Sanskrit by an attentive
study of Foster and Wilkins, without referring to native authorities;”
but he himself never went beyond, nor is there any evidence in his
published works that he himself tried to work his way through the
intricacies of Pâṇini.</p>

<p>In addition to his grammatical studies, Colebrooke was engaged in
several other subjects. He worked at the Supplement to the “Digest of
Laws,” which assumed very large proportions; he devoted some of his time
to the deciphering of ancient inscriptions, in the hope of finding some
fixed points in the history of India; he undertook to supply the
Oriental synonymes for Roxburgh’s “Flora Indica”&mdash;a most laborious
task, requiring a knowledge of botany as well as an intimate
acquaintance with Oriental languages. In 1804 and 1805, while preparing
his classical essay on the Vedas for the press, we find him approaching
the study of the religion of Buddha. In all these varied researches, it
is most interesting to observe the difference between him and all the
other contributors to the “Asiatic Researches” at that time. They were
all carried away by theories or enthusiasm; they were all betrayed into
assertions or conjectures which proved unfounded. Colebrooke alone, the
most hard-working and most comprehensive student, never allows one word
to escape his pen for which he has not his authority; and when he speaks
of the treatises of Sir W. Jones, Wilford, and others, he
<span class = "pagenum">385</span>
<a name = "page385" id = "page385"> </a>
readily admits that they contain curious matter, but as he expresses
himself, “very little conviction.” When speaking of his own work, as for
instance, what he had written on the Vedas, he says: “I&nbsp;imagine my
treatise on the Vedas will be thought curious; but, like the rest of my
publications, little interesting to the general reader.”</p>

<p>In 1805, Colebrooke became President of the Court of Appeal&mdash;a
high and, as it would seem, lucrative post, which made him unwilling to
aspire to any other appointment. His leisure, though more limited than
before, was devoted, as formerly, to his favorite studies; and in 1807
he accepted the presidency of the Asiatic Society&mdash;a post never
before or after filled so worthily. He not only contributed himself
several articles to the “Asiatic Researches,” published by the Society,
viz., “On the Sect of Jina,” “On the Indian and Arabic Divisions of the
Zodiack,” and “On the Frankincense of the Ancients;” but he encouraged
also many useful literary undertakings, and threw out, among other
things, an idea which has but lately been carried out, viz.,
a&nbsp;<i>Catalogue raisonné</i> of all that is extant in Asiatic
literature. His own studies became more and more concentrated on the
most ancient literature of India, the Vedas, and the question of their
real antiquity led him again to a more exhaustive examination of the
astronomical literature of the Brahmans. In all these researches, which
were necessarily of a somewhat conjectural character, Colebrooke was
guided by his usual caution. Instead of attempting, for instance,
a&nbsp;free and more or less divinatory translation of the hymns of the
Rig-Veda, he began with the tedious but inevitable work of exploring the
native
<span class = "pagenum">386</span>
<a name = "page386" id = "page386"> </a>
commentaries. No one who has not seen his MSS., now preserved at the
India Office, and the marginal notes with which the folios of Sâyaṇa’s
commentary are covered, can form any idea of the conscientiousness with
which he collected the materials for his essay. He was by no means a
blind follower of Sâyaṇa, or a believer in the infallibility of
traditional interpretation. The question on which so much useless
ingenuity has since been expended, whether in translating the Veda we
should be guided by native authorities or by the rules of critical
scholarship, must have seemed to him, as to every sensible person,
answered as soon as it was asked. He answered it by setting to work
patiently, in order to find out, first, all that could be learnt from
native scholars, and afterwards to form his own opinion. His experience
as a practical man, his judicial frame of mind, his freedom from
literary vanity, kept him, here as elsewhere, from falling into the pits
of learned pedantry. It will seem almost incredible to later generations
that German and English scholars should have wasted so much of their
time in trying to prove, either that we should take no notice whatever
of the traditional <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘intrepretation’">interpretation</ins> of the Veda, or that, in
following it, we should entirely surrender our right of private
judgment. Yet that is the controversy which has occupied of late years
some of our best Sanskrit scholars, which has filled our journals with
articles as full of learning as of acrimony, and has actually divided
the students of the history of ancient religion into two hostile camps.
Colebrooke knew that he had more useful work before him than to discuss
the infallibility of fallible interpreters&mdash;a question handled with
greater ingenuity by the Maimânsaka
<span class = "pagenum">387</span>
<a name = "page387" id = "page387"> </a>
philosophers than by any living casuists. He wished to leave substantial
work behind him; and though he claimed no freedom from error for
himself, yet he felt conscious of having done all his work carefully and
honestly, and was willing to leave it, such as it was, to the judgment
of his contemporaries and of posterity. Once only during the whole of
his life did he allow himself to be drawn into a literary controversy;
and here, too, he must have felt what most men feel in the
end&mdash;that it would have been better if he had not engaged in it.
The subject of the controversy was the antiquity and originality of
Hindu astronomy. Much had been written for and against it by various
writers, but by most of them without a full command of the necessary
evidence. Colebrooke himself maintained a doubtful attitude. He began,
as usual, with a careful study of the sources at that time available,
with translations of Sanskrit treatises, with astronomical calculations
and verifications; but, being unable to satisfy himself, he abstained
from giving a definite opinion. Bentley, who had published a paper in
which the antiquity and originality of Hindu astronomy were totally
denied, was probably aware that Colebrooke was not convinced by his
arguments. When, therefore, an adverse criticism of his views appeared
in the first number of our Review, Bentley jumped at the conclusion that
it was written or inspired by Colebrooke. Hence arose his animosity,
which lasted for many years, and vented itself from time to time in
virulent abuse of Colebrooke, whom Bentley accused not only of
unintentional error, but of willful misrepresentation and unfair
suppression of the truth. Colebrooke ought to have known that in the
republic of letters scholars are
<span class = "pagenum">388</span>
<a name = "page388" id = "page388"> </a>
sometimes brought into strange society. Being what he was, he need
not&mdash;nay, he ought not&mdash;to have noticed such literary
rowdyism. But as the point at issue was of deep interest to him, and as
he himself had a much higher opinion of Bentley’s real merits than his
reviewer, he at last vouchsafed an answer in the “Asiatic Journal” of
March, 1826. With regard to Bentley’s personalities, he says:
“I&nbsp;never spoke nor wrote of Mr. Bentley with disrespect, and I gave
no provocation for the tone of his attack on me.” As to the question
itself, he sums up his position with simplicity and dignity.
“I&nbsp;have been no favorer,” he writes, “no advocate of Indian
astronomy. I&nbsp;have endeavored to lay before the public, in an
intelligible form, the fruits of my researches concerning it.
I&nbsp;have repeatedly noticed its imperfections, and have been ready to
admit that it has been no scanty borrower as to theory.”</p>

<p>Colebrooke’s stay in India was a long one. He arrived there in 1782,
when only seventeen years of age, and he left it in 1815, at the age of
fifty. During all this time we see him uninterruptedly engaged in his
official work, and devoting all his leisure to literary labor. The
results which we have noticed so far, were already astonishing, and
quite sufficient to form a solid basis of his literary fame. But we have
by no means exhausted the roll of his works. We saw that a supplement to
the “Digest of Laws” occupied him for several years. In it he proposed
to recast the whole title of inheritance, so imperfectly treated in the
“Digest” which he translated, and supplement it with a series of
compilations on the several heads of Criminal Law, Pleading, and
Evidence, as treated by Indian jurists. In a letter to Sir T.
<span class = "pagenum">389</span>
<a name = "page389" id = "page389"> </a>
Strange he speaks of the Sanskrit text as complete, and of the
translation as considerably advanced; but it was not till 1810 that he
published, as a first installment, his translation of two important
treatises on inheritance, representing the views of different schools on
this subject. Much of the material which he collected with a view of
improving the administration of law in India, and bringing it into
harmony with the legal traditions of the country, remained unpublished,
partly because his labors were anticipated by timely reforms, partly
because his official duties became too onerous to allow him to finish
his work in a manner satisfactory to himself.</p>

<p>But although the bent of Colebrooke’s mind was originally scientific,
and the philological researches which have conferred the greatest lustre
on his name grew insensibly beneath his pen, the services he rendered to
Indian jurisprudence would deserve the highest praise and gratitude if
he had no other title to fame. Among his earlier studies he had applied
himself to the Roman law with a zeal uncommon among Englishmen of his
standing, and he has left behind him a treatise on the Roman Law of
Contracts. When he directed the same powers of investigation to the
sources of Indian law he found everything in confusion. The texts and
glosses were various and confused. The local customs which abound in
India had not been discriminated. Printing was of course unknown to
these texts; and as no supreme judicial intelligence and authority
existed to give unity to the whole system, nothing could be more
perplexing than the state of the law. From this chaos Colebrooke brought
forth order and light. The publication of the “Dhaya-bhâga,” as the
cardinal
<span class = "pagenum">390</span>
<a name = "page390" id = "page390"> </a>
exposition of the law of inheritance, which is the basis of Hindu
society, laid the foundation of no less a work than the revival of Hindu
jurisprudence, which had been overlaid by the Mohammedan conquest. On
this foundation a superstructure has now been raised by the combined
efforts of Indian and English lawyers: but the authority which is to
this day most frequently invoked as one of conclusive weight and
learning is that of Colebrooke. By the collection and revision of the
ancient texts which would probably have been lost without his
intervention, he became in some degree the legislator of India.</p>

<p>In 1807 he had been promoted to a seat in Council&mdash;the highest
honor to which a civilian, at the end of his career, could aspire. The
five years’ tenure of his office coincided very nearly with Lord Minto’s
Governor-generalship of India. During these five years the scholar
became more and more merged in the statesman. His marriage also took
place at the same time, which was destined to be happy, but short. Two
months after his wife’s death he sailed for England, determined to
devote the rest of his life to the studies which had become dear to him,
and which, as he now felt himself, were to secure to him the honorable
place of the father and founder of true Sanskrit scholarship in Europe.
Though his earliest tastes still attracted him strongly towards physical
science, and though, after his return to England, he devoted more time
than in India to astronomical, botanical, chemical, and geological
researches, yet, as an author, he remained true to his vocation as a
Sanskrit scholar, and he added some of the most important works to the
long list of his Oriental publications. How high an estimate he enjoyed
among
<span class = "pagenum">391</span>
<a name = "page391" id = "page391"> </a>
the students of physical science is best shown by his election as
President of the Astronomical Society, after the death of Sir John
Herschel in 1822. Some of his published contributions to the scientific
journals, chiefly on geological subjects, are said to be highly
speculative, which is certainly not the character of his Oriental works.
Nay, judging from the tenor of the works which he devoted to
scholarship, we should think that everything he wrote on other subjects
would deserve the most careful and unprejudiced attention, before it was
allowed to be forgotten; and we should be glad to see a complete edition
of all his writings, which have a character at once so varied and so
profound.</p>

<p>We have still to mention some of his more important Oriental
publications, which he either began or finished after his return to
England. The first is his “Algebra, with Arithmetic and Mensuration,
from the Sanskrit of Brahmagupta and Bhâskara, preceded by a
Dissertation on the State of the Sciences as known to the Hindus,”
London, 1817. It is still the standard work on the subject, and likely
to remain so, as an intimate knowledge of mathematics is but seldom
combined with so complete a mastery of Sanskrit as Colebrooke possessed.
He had been preceded by the labors of Burrow and E.&nbsp;Strachey; but
it is entirely due to him that mathematicians are now enabled to form a
clear idea of the progress which the Indians had made in this branch of
knowledge, especially as regards indeterminate analysis. It became
henceforth firmly established that the “Arabian Algebra had real points
of resemblance to that of the Indians, and not to that of the Greeks;
that the Diophantine analysis was only slightly cultivated
<span class = "pagenum">392</span>
<a name = "page392" id = "page392"> </a>
by the Arabs; and that, finally, the Indian was more scientific and
profound than either.” Some of the links in his argument, which
Colebrooke himself designated as weak, have since been subjected to
renewed criticism; but it is interesting to observe how here, too,
hardly anything really new has been added by subsequent scholars. The
questions of the antiquity of Hindu mathematics&mdash;of its indigenous
or foreign origin, as well as the dates to be assigned to the principal
Sanskrit writers, such as Bhâskara, Brahmagupta, Aryabhaṭṭa,
etc.,&mdash;are very much in the same state as he left them. And
although some living scholars have tried to follow in his footsteps, as
far as learning is concerned, they have never approached him in those
qualities which are more essential to the discovery of truth than mere
reading, viz., caution, fairness, and modesty.</p>

<p>Two events remain still to be noticed before we close the narrative
of the quiet and useful years which Colebrooke spent in England. In 1818
he presented his extremely valuable collection of Sanskrit MSS. to the
East India Company, and thus founded a treasury from which every student
of Sanskrit has since drawn his best supplies. It may be truly said,
that without the free access to this collection&mdash;granted to every
scholar, English or foreign&mdash;few of the really important
publications of Sanskrit texts, which have appeared during the last
fifty years, would have been possible; so that in this sense also,
Colebrooke deserves the title of the founder of Sanskrit scholarship in
Europe.</p>

<p>The last service which he rendered to Oriental literature was the
foundation of the Royal Asiatic Society. He had spent a year at the Cape
of Good
<span class = "pagenum">393</span>
<a name = "page393" id = "page393"> </a>
Hope, in order to superintend some landed property which he had acquired
there; and after his return to London, in 1822, he succeeded in creating
a society which should do in England the work which the Asiatic Society
of Bengal, founded in 1784 at Calcutta, by Sir W. Jones, had done in
India. Though he declined to become the first president, he became the
director of the new society. His object was not only to stimulate
Oriental scholars living in England to greater exertions, but likewise
to excite in the English public a more general interest in Oriental
studies. There was at that time far more interest shown in France and
Germany for the literature of the East than in England, though England
alone possessed an Eastern Empire. Thus we find Colebrooke writing in
one of his letters to Professor Wilson:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Schlegel, in what he said of some of us (English Orientalists) and of
our labors, did not purpose to be uncandid, nor to undervalue what has
been done. In your summary of what he said you set it to the right
account. I&nbsp;am not personally acquainted with him, though in
correspondence. I&nbsp;do think, with him, that as much has not been
done by the English as might have been expected from us. Excepting you
and me, and two or three more, who is there that has done anything! In
England nobody cares about Oriental literature, or is likely to give the
least attention to it.”</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“I rejoice to learn that your great work on the Indian drama may be soon
expected by us. I&nbsp;anticipate much gratification from a perusal.
Careless and indifferent as our countrymen are, I&nbsp;think,
nevertheless, you and I may derive some complacent feelings from the
reflection that, following the footsteps of Sir W. Jones, we have, with
so little aid of collaborators, and so little encouragement, opened
nearly every avenue, and left it to foreigners, who are taking up the
clue we have furnished, to complete the outline of what we have
sketched. It is some
<span class = "pagenum">394</span>
<a name = "page394" id = "page394"> </a>
gratification to national pride that the opportunity which the English
have enjoyed has not been wholly unemployed.”</p>

<p>Colebrooke’s last contributions to Oriental learning, which appeared
in the “Transactions” of the newly-founded Royal Asiatic Society,
consist chiefly in his masterly treatises on Hindu philosophy. In 1823
he read his paper on the Sânkhya system; in 1824 his paper on the Nyâya
and Vaiśeshika systems; in 1826 his papers on the Mîmânsâ; and, in 1827,
his two papers on Indian Sectaries and on the Vedânta. These papers,
too, still retain their value, unimpaired by later researches. They are
dry, and to those not acquainted with the subject they may fail to give
a living picture of the philosophical struggles of the Indian mind. But
the statements which they contain can, with very few exceptions, still
be quoted as authoritative, while those who have worked their way
through the same materials which he used for the compilation of his
essays, feel most struck by the conciseness with which he was able to
give the results of his extensive reading in this, the most abstruse
domain of Sanskrit literature. The publication of these papers on the
schools of Indian metaphysics, which anticipated with entire fidelity
the materialism and idealism of Greece and of modern thought, enabled
Victor Cousin to introduce a brilliant survey of the philosophy of India
into his Lectures on the History of Philosophy, first delivered, we
think, in 1828. Cousin knew and thought of Colebrooke exclusively as a
metaphysician. He probably cared nothing for his other labors. But as a
metaphysician he placed him in the first rank, and never spoke of him
without an expression of veneration, very unusual on the eloquent but

<p>The last years of Colebrooke’s life were full of suffering, both
bodily and mental. He died, after a lingering illness, on March 10,
1837.</p>

<p>To many even among those who follow the progress of Oriental
scholarship with interest and attention, the estimate which we have
given of Colebrooke’s merits may seem too high; but we doubt whether
from the inner circle of Sanskrit scholars, any dissentient voice will
be raised against our awarding to him the first place among
Sanskritists, both dead and living. The number of Sanskrit scholars has
by this time become considerable, and there is hardly a country in
Europe which may not be proud of some distinguished names. In India,
too, a&nbsp;new and most useful school of Sanskrit students is rising,
who are doing excellent work in bringing to light the forgotten
treasures of their country’s literature. But here we must, first of all,
distinguish between two classes of scholars. There are those who have
learnt enough of Sanskrit to be able to read texts that have been
published and translated, who can discuss their merits and defects,
correct some mistakes, and even produce new and more correct editions.
There are others who venture on new ground, who devote themselves to the
study of MSS., and who by editions of new texts, by translations of
works hitherto untranslated, or by essays on branches of literature not
yet explored, really add to the store of our knowledge. If we speak of
Colebrooke as <i>facile princeps</i> among Sanskrit scholars, we are
thinking of real scholars only, and we thus reduce the number of those
who could compete with him to a much smaller compass.</p>

<p>Secondly, we must distinguish between those who
<span class = "pagenum">396</span>
<a name = "page396" id = "page396"> </a>
came before Colebrooke and those who came after him, and who built on
his foundations. That among the latter class there are some scholars who
have carried on the work begun by Colebrooke beyond the point where he
left it, is no more than natural. It would be disgraceful if it were
otherwise, if we had not penetrated further into the intricacies of
Pâṇini, if we had not a more complete knowledge of the Indian systems of
philosophy, if we had not discovered in the literature of the Vedic
period treasures of which Colebrooke had no idea, if we had not improved
the standards of criticism which are to guide in the critical
restoration of Sanskrit texts. But in all these branches of Sanskrit
scholarship those who have done the best work are exactly those who
speak most highly of Colebrooke’s labors, They are proud to call
themselves his disciples. They would decline to be considered his
rivals.</p>

<p>There remains, therefore, in reality, only one who could be
considered a rival of Colebrooke, and whose name is certainly more
widely known than his, viz., Sir William Jones. It is by no means
necessary to be unjust to him in order to be just to Colebrooke. First
of all, he came before Colebrooke, and had to scale some of the most
forbidding outworks of Sanskrit scholarship. Secondly, Sir William Jones
died young, Colebrooke lived to a good old age. Were we speaking only of
the two men, and their personal qualities, we should readily admit that
in some respects Sir W. Jones stood higher than Colebrooke. He was
evidently a man possessed of great originality, of a highly cultivated
taste, and of an exceptional power of assimilating the exotic beauty of
Eastern poetry. We may go even further, and
<span class = "pagenum">397</span>
<a name = "page397" id = "page397"> </a>
frankly admit that, possibly, without the impulse given to Oriental
scholarship through Sir William Jones’s influence and example, we should
never have counted Colebrooke’s name among the professors of Sanskrit.
But we are here speaking not of the men, but of the works which they
left behind; and here the difference between the two is enormous. The
fact is, that Colebrooke was gifted with the critical conscience of a
scholar&mdash;Sir W. Jones was not. Sir W. Jones could not wish for
higher testimony in his favor than that of Colebrooke himself.
Immediately after his death, Colebrooke wrote to his father, June,
1794:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Since I wrote to you the world has sustained an irreparable loss in the
death of Sir W. Jones. As a judge, as a constitutional lawyer, and for
his amiable qualities in private life, he must have been lost with
heartfelt regret. But his loss as a literary character will be felt in a
wider circle. It was his intention shortly to have returned to Europe,
where the most valuable works might have been expected from his pen. His
premature death leaves the results of his researches unarranged, and
must lose to the world much that was only committed to memory, and much
of which the notes must be unintelligible to those into whose hands his
papers fall. It must be long before he is replaced in the same career of
literature, if he is ever so. None of those who are now engaged in
Oriental researches are so fully informed in the classical languages of
the East; and I fear that, in the progress of their inquiries, none will
be found to have such comprehensive views.”</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“You ask how we are to supply his place? Indeed, but ill. Our present
and future presidents may preside with dignity and propriety; but who
can supply his place in diligent and ingenious researches? Not even the
combined efforts of the whole Society; and the field is large, and few
the cultivators.”</p>

<p>Still later in life, when a reaction had set in, and
<span class = "pagenum">398</span>
<a name = "page398" id = "page398"> </a>
the indiscriminate admiration of Sir W. Jones had given way to an
equally indiscriminate depreciation of his merits, Colebrooke, who was
then the most competent judge, writes to his father:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“As for the other point you mention, the use of a translation by
Wilkins, without acknowledgment, I&nbsp;can bear testimony that Sir W.
Jones’s own labors in Manu sufficed without the aid of a translation. He
had carried an interlineary Latin version through all the difficult
chapters; he had read the original three times through, and he had
carefully studied the commentaries. This I know, because it appears
clearly so from the copies of Manu and his commentators which Sir
William used, and which I have seen. I&nbsp;must think that he paid a
sufficient compliment to Wilkins, when he said, that without his aid he
should never have learned Sanskrit. I&nbsp;observe with regret a growing
disposition, here and in England, to depreciate Sir W. Jones’s merits.
It has not hitherto shown itself beyond private circles and
conversation. Should the same disposition be manifested in print,
I&nbsp;shall think myself bound to bear public testimony to his
attainments in Sanskrit.”</p>

<p>Such candid appreciation of the merits of Sir W. Jones, conveyed in a
private letter, and coming from the pen of the only person then
competent to judge both of the strong and the weak points in the
scholarship of Sir William Jones, ought to caution us against any
inconsiderate judgment. Yet we do not hesitate to declare that, as
Sanskrit scholars, Sir William Jones and Colebrooke cannot be compared.
Sir William had explored a few fields only, Colebrooke had surveyed
almost the whole domain of Sanskrit literature. Sir William was able to
read fragments of epic poetry, a&nbsp;play, and the laws of Manu. But
the really difficult works, the grammatical treatises and commentaries,
the philosophical systems, and, before all, the immense literature of
the Vedic period, were never seriously approached by him. Sir William
<span class = "pagenum">399</span>
<a name = "page399" id = "page399"> </a>
Jones reminds us sometimes of the dashing and impatient general who
tries to take every fortress by bombardment or by storm, while
Colebrooke never trusts to anything but a regular siege. They will both
retain places of honor in our literary Walhallas. But ask any librarian,
and he will say that at the present day the collected works of Sir W.
Jones are hardly ever consulted by Sanskrit scholars, while Colebrooke’s
essays are even now passing through a new edition, and we hope Sir
Edward Colebrooke will one day give the world a complete edition of his
father’s works.</p>

Oxford, September, 1874.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">I mentioned</span> in my Address before the
Aryan section of the Oriental Congress that I possessed some MS. notes
of Colebrooke’s on Comparative Philology. They were sent to me some time
ago by his son, Sir E. Colebrooke, who gave me leave to publish them, if
I thought them of sufficient importance. They were written down, as far
as we know, about the years 1801 or 1802, and contain long lists of
words expressive of some of the most important elements of early
civilization, in Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Teutonic, Celtic, and Slavonic.
Like everything that Colebrooke wrote, these lists are prepared with
great care. They exist in rough notes, in a first, and in a second copy.
I&nbsp;give them from the second copy, in which many words from less
important languages are omitted, and several doubtful comparisons
suppressed. I&nbsp;have purposely altered nothing, for the interest of
these lists is chiefly historical, showing how, long before the days of
Bopp and Grimm, Colebrooke had clearly perceived the relationship of all
the principal branches of the Aryan family, and, what is more important,
how he had anticipated the historical conclusions which a comparison of
the principal words of the great dialects of the Aryan family enables us
to draw with regard to the state of civilization anterior to the first
separation of
<span class = "pagenum">401</span>
<a name = "page401" id = "page401"> </a>
the Aryan race. No one acquainted with the progress which Comparative
Philology has made during the last seventy years would think of quoting
some of the comparisons here suggested by Colebrooke as authoritative.
The restraints which phonetic laws have since imposed on the comparison
of words were unknown in his days. But with all that, it is most
surprising to see how careful Colebrooke was, even when he had to guess,
and how well he succeeded in collecting those words which form the
earliest common dictionary of our ancestors, and supply the only
trustworthy materials for a history of the very beginnings of the Aryan
race.</p>

MY REPLY TO MR. DARWIN.</h3>

<hr class = "micro">

<p><span class = "firstword">During</span> the whole of the year that
has just passed away, all my spare time has been required for the
completion of my edition of the Rig-Veda and its Sanskrit commentary.
I&nbsp;had to shut my eyes to everything else. Many a book which I felt
tempted to read was put aside, and hardly a single Review could draw me
away from my purpose. Thus it has come to pass that I did not know, till
a few days ago, that some Lectures which I had delivered at the Royal
Institution on “Mr. Darwin’s Philosophy of Language,” and which had been
fully reported in “Fraser’s Magazine” for May, June, and July, 1873, had
elicited a reply emanating from one who writes if not in, at least with
Mr. Darwin’s name, and who himself would be, no doubt most proud to
acknowledge the influence of “family bias.” I&nbsp;could not have
guessed from the title of the paper, “Professor Whitney on the Origin of
Language: by George H. Darwin,” that it was meant as an answer to the
arguments which I had ventured to advance in my Lectures at the Royal
Institution against Mr. Darwin’s views on language. It was only when
telling a friend that I soon hoped to find time to complete those
Lectures, that I was asked whether I had seen Darwin’s
<span class = "pagenum">418</span>
<a name = "page418" id = "page418"> </a>
reply. I&nbsp;read it at once in the November number of the
“Contemporary Review;” and, as it will take some time before I can hope
to finish my book on “Language as the true barrier between Man and
Beast,” I&nbsp;determined, in the meantime, to publish a brief rejoinder
to the defense of Mr. Darwin’s philosophy, so ably and chivalrously
conducted by his son.</p>

<p>With regard to the proximate cause of Mr. Darwin’s defense of his
father’s views on language&mdash;viz. an article in the “Quarterly
Review,” I&nbsp;may say at once that I knew nothing about it till I saw
Mr. G. Darwin’s article; and if there should be any suspicion in Mr.
Darwin’s mind that the writer in the “Quarterly Review” is in any sense
of the word my <i>alter ego</i> I can completely remove that
impression.</p>

<p>It seems that the writer in the “Quarterly” expressed himself in the
following terms with regard to Mr. Darwin’s competency on linguistic
problems:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Few recent intellectual phenomena are more astounding than the
ignorance of these elementary yet fundamental distinctions and
principles (<i>i.e.</i>, as to the essence of language) exhibited by
conspicuous advocates of the monistic hypothesis. Mr. Darwin, for
example, does not exhibit the faintest indication of having grasped
them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin, I mean the father, if he has read my lectures, or
anything else I have written, might easily have known that that is not
the tone in which I write, least of all when speaking of men who have
rendered such excellent service to the advancement of science as the
author of the book “On the Origin of Species.” To me, the few pages
devoted to language by Mr. Darwin were full of interest, as showing the
conclusions to which that school of philosophy which he so worthily
represents is driven with regard to the
<span class = "pagenum">419</span>
<a name = "page419" id = "page419"> </a>
nature and origin of language. If put into more becoming language,
however, I&nbsp;do not think there would be anything offensive in
stating that Mr. Darwin, Sr., knows the results of the Science of
Language at second hand only, and that his opinions on the subject,
however interesting as coming from him, cannot be accepted or quoted as
authoritative. It has often done infinite mischief when men who have
acquired a right to speak with authority on one subject, express
opinions on other subjects with which they are but slightly acquainted.
These opinions, though never intended for that purpose, are sure to be
invested by others, particularly by interested persons, with an
authority to which in themselves they have no right whatever. It is true
it would be difficult to carry on any scientific work, without to some
extent recognizing the authority of those who have established their
claim to a certain amount of infallibility within their own special
spheres of study. But when either the Pope expresses an opinion on
astronomy, or the Duke of Wellington on a work of art, they certainly
ought not to be offended if asked for their reasons, like any other
mortals. No linguistic student, if he had ventured to express an opinion
on the fertilization of orchids, differing from that of Mr. Darwin,
would feel aggrieved by being told that his opinion, though showing
intelligence, did not show that real grasp of the whole bearing of the
problem which can be acquired by a life-long devotion only. If the
linguistic student, who may be fond of orchids, cared only for a
temporary triumph in the eyes of the world, he might easily find, among
the numerous antagonists of Mr. Darwin, one who agreed with himself, and
appeal to him as showing that he, though a
<span class = "pagenum">420</span>
<a name = "page420" id = "page420"> </a>
mere layman in the Science of Botany, was supported in his opinions by
other distinguished botanists. But no real advance in the discovery of
truth can ever be achieved by such mere cleverness. How can the
soundness and truth of Mr. Darwin’s philosophy of language be
established by an appeal like that with which Mr. Darwin, Jr., opens his
defense of his father?</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Professor Whitney,” he says, “is the first philologist of note who has
professedly taken on himself to combat the views of Professor Max
Müller; and as the opinions of the latter most properly command a vast
deal of respect in England, we think it will be good service to direct
the attention of English readers to this powerful attack, and, as we
think, successful refutation of the somewhat dogmatic views of our
Oxford linguist.”</p>

<p>First of all, nothing would convey a more erroneous impression than
to say that Professor Whitney was the first philologist of note who has
combated my views. There is as much combat in the linguistic as in the
physical camp, though Mr. Darwin may not be aware of it. Beginning with
Professor Pott, I&nbsp;could give a long list of most illustrious
scholars in Germany, France, Italy, and surely in England also, who have
subjected my views on language to a far more searching criticism than
Professor Whitney in America. But even if Professor Whitney were the
only philologist who differed from me, or agreed with Mr. Darwin, how
would that affect the soundness of Mr. Darwin’s theories on language?
Suppose I were to quote in return the opinion of M.&nbsp;Renouvier, the
distinguished author of “Les Principes de la Nature,” who, in his
journal, “La Critique Philosophique,” expresses his conviction that my
criticism of Mr. Darwin’s philosophy contains not a simple
<i>polémique</i>, but
<span class = "pagenum">421</span>
<a name = "page421" id = "page421"> </a>
has the character of a <i>rédressement</i>; would that dishearten Mr.
Darwin? I&nbsp;must confess that I had never before read Professor
Whitney’s “Lectures on Language,” which were published in America in
1867; and I ought to thank Mr. Darwin for having obliged me to do so
now, for I have seldom perused a book with greater interest and
pleasure,&mdash;I might almost say, amusement. It was like walking
through old familiar places, like listening to music which one knows one
has heard before somewhere, and, for that very reason, enjoys all the
more. Not unfrequently I was met by the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of my own
lectures on the Science of Language, though immediately after they
seemed to be changed into an inverted fugue. Often I saw how carefully
the same books and pamphlets which I had waded through had been studied:
and on almost every page there were the same doubts and difficulties,
the same hopes and fears, the same hesitations and misgivings through
which I myself well remembered having passed when preparing my two
series of “Lectures on Language.” Of course, we must not expect in
Professor Whitney’s Lectures, anything like a systematic or exhaustive
treatment. They touch on points which were most likely to interest large
audiences at Washington, and other towns in America. They were meant to
be popular, and nothing would be more unfair than to blame an author for
not giving what he did not mean to give. The only just complaint we have
heard made about these Lectures is that they give sometimes too much of
what is irreverently called “padding.” Professor Whitney had read my own
Lectures before writing his; and though he is quite right in saying the
principal facts on which his reasonings
<span class = "pagenum">422</span>
<a name = "page422" id = "page422"> </a>
are founded have been for some time past the commonplaces of Comparative
Philology, and required no acknowledgment, he makes an honorable
exception in my favor, and acknowledges most readily having borrowed
here and there an illustration from my Lectures. As to my own views on
the Science of Language, I&nbsp;am glad to find that on all really
important points, he far more frequently indorses them&mdash;nay,
corroborates them by new proofs and illustrations&mdash;than attempts to
refute them; and even in the latter case he generally does so by simply
pronouncing his decided preference for one out of two opinions, while I
had been satisfied with stating what could be said on either side. He
might here and there have tempered the wind to the shorn lamb, but I
believe there is far more license allowed in America, in the expression
of dissent, than in England; and it is both interesting and instructive
in the study of Dialectic Growth, to see how words which would be
considered offensive in England, have ceased to be so on the other side
of the Atlantic, and are admitted into the most respectable of American
Reviews.</p>

<p>With regard to the question, for instance, on which so much has
lately been written, whether we ought to ascribe to language a natural
growth or historical change, I&nbsp;see not one single argument produced
on either side of the question in Professor Whitney’s Second Lecture,
beyond those which I had discussed in my Second Lecture. After stating
all that could be said in support of extending the name of history to
the gradual development of language, I&nbsp;tried to show that, after
all, that name would not be quite accurate.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“The process,” I&nbsp;said, “through which language is settled
<span class = "pagenum">423</span>
<a name = "page423" id = "page423"> </a>
and unsettled combines in one the two opposite elements of necessity and
free will. Though the individual seems to be the prime agent in
producing new words and new grammatical forms, he is so only after his
individuality has been merged in the common action of the family, tribe,
or nation to which he belongs. He can do nothing by himself, and the
first impulse to a new formation in language, though given by an
individual, is mostly, if not always, given without premeditation, nay,
unconsciously. The individual, as such, is powerless, and the results,
apparently produced by him, depend on laws beyond his control, and on
the coöperation of all those who form together with him one class, one
body, one organic whole.” (Page&nbsp;43.)</p>

<p>After going through the whole argument, I summed up in the end by
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“We cannot be careful enough in the use of our words. Strictly speaking,
neither <i>history</i> nor <i>growth</i> is applicable to the changes of
the shifting surface of the earth. <i>History</i> applies to the actions
of free agents, <i>growth</i> to the natural unfolding of organic
beings. We speak, however, of the growth of the crust of the earth,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVIII_1" id = "tagVIII_1" href =
"#noteVIII_1">1</a> and we know what we mean by it; and it is in this
sense, but not in the sense of growth as applied to a tree, that we have
a right to speak of the growth of language.”</p>

<p>What do we find in Professor Whitney’s Second Lecture? He objects,
like myself, to comparing the growth of language and the growth of a
tree, and like myself, he admits of an excuse, viz., when the metaphor
is employed for the sake of brevity or liveliness of delineation
(p.&nbsp;35). I&nbsp;had said:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Ever since Horace, it has been usual to compare the changes of language
with the growth of trees. But comparisons are treacherous things; and
though we cannot help using metaphorical expressions, we should always
be on our guard,” etc.</p>

<p>So far we are in perfect harmony. But immediately
<span class = "pagenum">424</span>
<a name = "page424" id = "page424"> </a>
after, the wind begins to blow. One sentence is torn out from the
context, where I had said:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“That it is not in the power of man (not men) either to produce or to
prevent change in language; that we might think as well of changing the
laws which control the circulation of our blood, or of adding an inch to
our height, as of altering the laws of speech, or inventing new words,
<i>according to our pleasure</i>.”</p>

<p>In order to guard against every possible apprehension as to what I
meant by <i>according to our pleasure</i>, I quoted the well-known
anecdotes of the Emperor Tiberius and of the Emperor Sigismund, and
referred to the attempts of Protagoras, and other purists, as equally
futile. Here the Republican indignation of the American writer is
roused; I, at least, can find no other motive. He tells me that what I
really wanted to say was this:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“If so high and mighty a personage as an emperor could not do so small a
thing as alter the gender and termination of a single word&mdash;much
less can any one of inferior consideration hope to accomplish such a
change.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>He then exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“The utter futility of deriving such a doctrine from such a pair of
incidents, or a thousand like them, is almost too obvious to be worth
the trouble of pointing out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. High political station
does not confer the right to make or unmake language,” etc.</p>

<p>Now every reader, even though looking only at these short extracts,
will see that the real point of my argument is here entirely missed,
though I do not mean to say that it was intentionally missed. The stress
was laid by me on the words <i>according to our pleasure</i>; and in
order to elucidate that point, I&nbsp;first quoted instances taken from
those who in other matters have the right of saying <i>car tel est mon
plaisir</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">425</span>
<a name = "page425" id = "page425"> </a>
and then from others. I&nbsp;feel a little guilty in not having
mentioned the anecdote about <i>carrosse</i>; but not being able to
verify it, I&nbsp;thought I might leave it to my opponents. However,
after having quoted the two Emperors, I&nbsp;quoted a more humble
personage, Protagoras, and referred to other attempts at purism in
language; but all that is, of course, passed over by my critic, as not
answering his purpose.</p>

<p>Sometimes, amidst all the loud assertion of difference of opinion on
Professor Whitney’s part, not only the substantial, but strange to say,
the verbal agreement between his and my own Second Lecture is startling.
I&nbsp;had said: “The first impulse to a new formation in language,
though given by an individual, is mostly, if not always, given
<i>without premeditation</i>, nay, <i>unconsciously</i>.” My antagonist
varies this very slightly and says: “The work of each individual is done
<i>unpremeditately, or, as it were, unconsciously</i>” (p.&nbsp;45).
While I had said that we individually can no more change language,
<i>selon notre plaisir</i>, than we can add an inch to our stature,
Professor Whitney again adopts a slight alteration and expresses himself
as follows: “They (the facts of language) are almost as little the work
of man as is the form of his skull” (p.&nbsp;52). What is the difference
between us? What is the difference between changing our stature and
changing our skull? Nor does he use the word growth as applied to
language, less frequently than myself; nay, sometimes he uses it so
entirely without the necessary limitations, that even I should have
shrunk from adopting his phraseology. We read&mdash;“In this sense
language is a growth” (p.&nbsp;46); “a&nbsp;language, like an organic
body, is no mere aggregate of similar
<span class = "pagenum">426</span>
<a name = "page426" id = "page426"> </a>
particles&mdash;it is a complex of related and mutually helpful parts”
(p.&nbsp;46); “language is fitly comparable with an organized body”
(p.&nbsp;50); “compared with them, language is a real growth”
(p.&nbsp;51); etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>In fact, after all has been said by Professor Whitney that had been
said before, the only difference that remains is this&mdash;that he,
after making all these concessions, prefers to class the Science of
Language as an historical, not as a physical science. Why should he not?
Everybody who is familiar with such questions, knows that all depends on
a clear and accurate definition of the terms which we employ. The method
of the Science of Language and the physical sciences is admitted, even
by him, to be the same (p.&nbsp;52). Everything therefore depends on the
wider or narrower definition which we adopt of physical science. Enlarge
the definition of the natural sciences, and the science of language will
enter in freely; narrow it, and it will enter with difficulty, or not at
all. The same with the historical sciences. Enlarge their definition,
and the science of language will enter in freely; narrow it, and it will
enter with difficulty, or not at all. There is hardly a word that is
used in so many different meanings as nature, and that man in many of
his apparently freest acts is under the sway of unsuspected laws of
nature, cannot sound so very novel to a student of Kant’s writings, to
say nothing of later philosophers.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVIII_2" id
= "tagVIII_2" href = "#noteVIII_2">2</a> My principal object in claiming
for the Science of Language the name of a physical science, was to make
it quite clear, once for all, that Comparative Philology was totally
distinct from ordinary Philology, that it treats language
<span class = "pagenum">427</span>
<a name = "page427" id = "page427"> </a>
not as a vehicle of literature, but for its own sake; that it wants to
explain the origin and development far more than the idiomatic use of
words, and that for all these purposes it must adopt a strictly
inductive method. Many of these views which, when I delivered my first
lectures, met with very determined opposition, are now generally
accepted, and I can well understand, that younger readers should be
surprised at the elaborate and minute arguments by which I tried to show
in what sense the Science of Language may be counted as one of the
physical sciences. Let them but read other books of the same period, and
they will see with how much zeal these questions were then being
discussed, particularly in England. Writing in England, and chiefly for
English readers, I&nbsp;tried as much as possible to adapt myself to the
intellectual atmosphere of that country, and as to the classification of
the inductive sciences, I&nbsp;started from that which was then most
widely known, that of Whewell in his “History of the Inductive
Sciences.” He classes the Science of Language as one of the
palaitiological sciences, but makes a distinction between
palaitiological sciences treating of material things&mdash;for instance,
geology, and others respecting the products which result from man’s
imaginative and social endowments&mdash;for instance, Comparative
Philology. He still excludes the latter from the circle of the physical
sciences,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVIII_3" id = "tagVIII_3" href =
"#noteVIII_3">3</a> properly so called, but he adds:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“We have seen that biology leads us to psychology, if we choose to
follow the path; and thus the passage from the
<span class = "pagenum">428</span>
<a name = "page428" id = "page428"> </a>
material to the immaterial has already unfolded itself at one point; and
we now perceive that there are several large provinces of speculation
which concern subjects belonging to man’s immaterial nature, and which
are governed by the same laws as sciences altogether physical. It is not
our business to dwell on the prospects which our philosophy thus opens
to our contemplation: but we may allow ourselves, in this last stage of
our pilgrimage among the foundations of the physical sciences, to be
cheered and animated by the ray that thus beams upon us, however dimly,
from a higher and brighter region.”</p>

<p>Considering the high position which Dr. Whewell held among the
conflicting parties of philosophic and religious thought in England, we
should hardly have expected that the hope which he expressed of a
possible transition from the material to the immaterial, and the place
which he tentatively, and I more decidedly, assigned to the Science of
Language, could have roused any orthodox animosities. Yet here is the
secret spring of Professor Whitney’s efforts to claim for the Science of
Language, in spite of his own admissions as a scholar, a&nbsp;place
among the moral and historical, as distinct from the physical sciences.
The theological bias, long kept back, breaks through at last, and we are
treated to the following sermon:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“There is a school of modern philosophers who are trying to materialize
all science, to eliminate the distinction between the physical and the
intellectual and moral, to declare for nought the free action of the
human will, and to resolve the whole story of the fates of mankind into
a series of purely material effects, produced by assignable physical
causes, and explainable in the past, or determinable in the future, by
an intimate knowledge of those causes, by a recognition of the action of
compulsory
<span class = "pagenum">429</span>
<a name = "page429" id = "page429"> </a>
motives upon the passively obedient nature of man. With such, language
will naturally pass, along with the rest, for a physical product, and
its study for physical science; and, however we may dissent from their
general classification, we cannot quarrel with its application in the
particular instance. But by those who still hold to the grand
distinction,” etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>At the end of this arguing <i>pro</i> and <i>con.</i>, the matter
itself remains exactly where it was before. The Science of Language is a
physical science, if we extend the meaning of nature so far as to
include human nature, in those manifestations at least where the
individual does not act freely, but under reciprocal restraint. The
Science of Language is an historical, or, as Professor Whitney prefers
to call it, a&nbsp;moral science, if we comprehend under history the
acts performed by men “unpremeditately, or, as it were, unconsciously,”
and therefore beyond the reach of moral considerations.</p>

<p>I may seem to have entered more fully into this question than its
real importance requires, but I was anxious, before replying to Mr.
Darwin’s objections, to show to him the general style of argument that
pervades Professor Whitney’s writings, and the character of the armory
from which he has borrowed his weapons against me. I&nbsp;have not been
able to get access to Professor Whitney’s last article, and shall
therefore confine myself here to those arguments only which Mr. Darwin
has adopted as his own, though, even if I had seen the whole of the
American article, I&nbsp;should have preferred not to enter into any
personal controversy with Professor Whitney. I&nbsp;have expressed my
sincere appreciation of the industry and acumen which that scholar
displays in his lectures on the Science of Language. There are some
portions, particularly those on the Semitic and
<span class = "pagenum">430</span>
<a name = "page430" id = "page430"> </a>
American languages, where he has left me far behind. There are some
illustrations extremely well chosen, and worked out with a touch of
poetic genius; there are whole chapters where by keeping more on the
surface of his subject, he has succeeded in making it far more
attractive and popular than I could have hoped to do. That treatment,
however, entails its dangers, unless an author remembers, at every
moment, that in addressing a popular audience he is in honor bound to be
far more careful than if he writes for his own professional colleagues
only. The comparative portion, I&nbsp;mean particularly the Seventh
Lecture, is hardly what one would have expected from so experienced a
teacher, and it is strange to find (p.&nbsp;219) the inscription on the
Duilian column referred to about <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>
263, after Ritschl and Mommsen had pointed out its affected archaisms;
to see (p.&nbsp;222) the name Ahura-Mazda rendered by “the mighty
spirit;” to meet (p.&nbsp;258) with “sarvanâman,” the Sanskrit name for
pronoun, translated by “name for everything, universal designation;” to
hear the Phœnician alphabet still spoken of as the <i>ultimate</i>
source of the world’s alphabets, etc. Such mistakes, however, can be
corrected, but what can never be corrected is the unfortunate tone which
Professor Whitney has adopted throughout. His one object seems to be to
show to his countrymen that he is the equal of Bopp, Renan, Schleicher,
Steinthal, Bleek, Hang, and others&mdash;aye, their superior. In stating
their opinions, in criticizing their work, in suggesting motives, he
shrinks from nothing, evidently trusting to the old adage, <i>semper
aliquid hœret</i>. I have often asked myself, why should Professor
Whitney have assumed this exceptional position
<span class = "pagenum">431</span>
<a name = "page431" id = "page431"> </a>
among Comparative Philologists. It is not American to attack others,
simply in order to acquire notoriety. America has possessed, and still
possesses, some excellent scholars, whom every one of these German and
French <i>savants</i> would be proud to acknowledge as his peers. Mr.
Marsh’s “Lectures on the English Language” are a recognized standard
work in England; Professor’s March’s “Anglo-Saxon Grammar” has been
praised by everybody. Why is there no trace of self-assertion or
personal abuse in any of their works? It is curious to observe in
Professor Whitney’s works, that the less he has thought on certain
subjects, the louder he speaks, and where arguments fail him,
<i>epitheta ornantia</i>, such as <i>worthless</i>, <i>futile</i>,
<i>absurd</i>, <i>ridiculous</i>, <i>superficial</i>, <i>unsound</i>,
<i>high-flown</i>, <i>pretentious</i>, <i>disingenuous</i>,
<i>false</i>, are poured out in abundance. I&nbsp;believe there is not
one of these choice counters with which, at some time or other, he has
not presented me; nay, he has even poured the soothing oil of praise
over my bruised head. <i>Quand on se permet tout, on peut faire quelque
chose.</i> But what has been the result? It has actually become a
distinction to belong to the noble army of his martyrs, while, whenever
one is praised by him, one feels inclined to say with Phocion, <span
class = "greek" title = "ou dê pou ti kakon legôn emauton lelêtha">οὐ δὴ
πού τι κακὸν λέγων ἐμαυτὸν λέληθα</span>.</p>

<p>What such behavior may lead to, we have lately seen in an encounter
between the same American <i>savant</i> and Professor Steinthal, of
Berlin.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVIII_4" id = "tagVIII_4" href =
"#noteVIII_4">4</a> In his earlier writings Professor Whitney spoke of
Professor Steinthal as an eminent master in linguistic science, from
whose writings he had derived the greatest instruction and
enlightenment. Afterwards the
<span class = "pagenum">432</span>
<a name = "page432" id = "page432"> </a>
friendly relations between the Yale and Berlin professors seem to have
changed, and at last Professor Steinthal became so exasperated by the
misrepresentations and the overbearing tone of the American linguist,
that he, in a moment of irritation, forgot himself so far as to
retaliate with the same missiles with which he had been assailed. What
the missiles used in such encounters are, may be seen from a few
specimens. One could hardly quote them all in an English Review. While
dwelling on the system of bold misrepresentation adopted by Professor
Whitney, Professor Steinthal calls him&mdash;“That vain man who only
wants to be named and praised;” “that horrible humbug;” “that scolding
flirt;” “that tricky attorney;” “wherever I read him, hollow vacuity
yawns in my face; arrogant vanity grins at me.” Surely, mere words can
go no further&mdash;we must expect to hear of tomahawk and bowie-knife
next. Scholars who object to the use of such weapons, whether for
offensive or defensive purposes, can do nothing but what I have done for
years&mdash;remain silent, select what is good in Professor Whitney’s
writings, and try to forget the rest.</p>

<p>Surely, students of language, of all people in the world, ought to
know what words are made of, and how easy it is to pour out a whole
dictionary of abuse without producing the slightest effect. A&nbsp;page
of offensive language weighs nothing&mdash;it simply shows the gall of
bitterness and the weakness of the cause; whereas real learning, real
love of truth, real sympathy with our fellow-laborers, manifest
themselves in a very different manner. There were philosophers of old
who held that words must have been produced by nature, not by art,
because curses produced such terrible
<span class = "pagenum">433</span>
<a name = "page433" id = "page433"> </a>
effects. Professor Whitney holds that language was produced <span class
= "greek" title = "thesei">θέσει</span>, not <span class = "greek" title
= "phusei">φύσει</span>, and yet he shares the same superstitious faith
in words. He bitterly complains that those whom he reviles, do not
revile him again. He wonders that no one answers his strictures, and he
is gradually becoming convinced that he is unanswerable. Whatever Mr.
Darwin, Jr., may think of Professor Whitney as an ally, I&nbsp;feel
certain that Mr. Darwin, Sr., would be the last to approve the spirit of
his works, and that a few pages of his controversial writings would make
him say: <i>Non tali auxilio.</i></p>

<p>I now proceed to examine some of the extracts which Mr. Darwin, Jr.,
adopts from Professor Whitney’s article, and even in them we shall see
at once what I may call the spirit of the advocate, though others might
call it by another name.</p>

<p>Instead of examining the facts on which my conclusions were founded,
or showing, by one or two cases, at least, that I had made a mistake or
offended against the strict rules of logic, there appears the following
sweeping exordium, which has done service before in many an opening
address of the counsel for the defendant:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“It is never entirely easy to reduce to a skeleton of logical statement
a discussion as carried on by Müller, because he is careless of logical
sequence and connection, preferring to pour himself out, as it were,
over his subject, in a gush of genial assertion and interesting
illustration.”</p>

<p>Where is the force of such a sentence? It is a mere pouring out of
assertions, though without any interesting illustration, and not exactly
genial. All we learn from it is, that Professor Whitney does not find it
entirely easy to reduce what I have written to
<span class = "pagenum">434</span>
<a name = "page434" id = "page434"> </a>
a skeleton of logical sequence, but whether the fault is mine or his,
remains surely to be proved. There may be a very strong logical backbone
in arguments which make the least display of Aldrich, while in others
there is a kind of whited and sepulchral logic which seldom augurs well
for what is behind and beneath.</p>

<p>There is a very simple rule of logic, sometimes called the Law of the
Excluded Middle, according to which either a given proposition or its
contradictory must be true. By selecting passages somewhat freely from
different parts of Professor Whitney’s lectures, nothing would be easier
than to prove, and not simply to assert that he has violated again and
again that fundamental principle. In his earlier Lectures we are told,
that “to ascribe the differences of language and linguistic growth
directly to physical causes, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is wholly
meaningless and futile” (p.&nbsp;152). When we come to the great variety
of the American languages, we are told that “their differentiation has
been favored by the influence of the variety of climate and mode of
life.” On page 40, we read that a great genius “may now and then coin a
new word!” On page 123, we are told “it is not true that a genius can
impress a marked effect upon language.” On page 177, M.&nbsp;Renan and
myself are told that we have committed a serious error in admitting
dialects as antecedent feeders of national or classical languages, and
that it is hardly worth while to spend any effort in refuting such an
opinion. On page 181, we read, “a&nbsp;certain degree of dialectic
variety is inseparable from the being of any language,” etc., etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>I should not call this a fair way of dealing with any book;
I&nbsp;only give these few specimens to show
<span class = "pagenum">435</span>
<a name = "page435" id = "page435"> </a>
that the task of changing Professor Whitney’s Lecture into a logical
skeleton would not always be an easy one.</p>

<p>The pleading is now carried on by Mr. G. Darwin:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“In taking up the cudgels, Müller is <i>clearly</i> impelled by an
overmastering fear lest man should lose ‘his proud position in the
creation’ if his animal descent is proved.”</p>

<p>I should in nowise be ashamed of the fear thus ascribed to me, but
whether it was an overmastering fear, let those judge who have read such
passages in my Lectures, as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“The question is not whether the belief that animals so distant as a
man, a&nbsp;monkey, an elephant, and a humming bird, a&nbsp;snake,
a&nbsp;frog, and a fish, could all have sprung from the same parents is
monstrous, but simply and solely whether it is true. If it is true, we
shall soon learn to digest it. Appeals to the pride or humility of man,
to scientific courage, or religious piety, are all equally out of
place.”</p>

<p>If this and other passages in my Lectures are inspired by
overmastering fear, then surely Talleyrand was right in saying that
language was intended to disguise our thoughts. And may I not add, that
if such charges can be made with impunity, we shall soon have to say,
with a still more notorious diplomatist, “What is truth?” Such reckless
charges may look heroic, but what applied to the famous charge of
Balaclava, applies to them: <i>C’est magnifique, sans doute, mais ce
n’est pas la guerre.</i></p>

<p>I am next charged, I do not know whether by the senior or the junior
counsel, with maintaining the extraordinary position that if an
insensible graduation could be established between ape and man, their
minds would be <i>identical</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">436</span>
<a name = "page436" id = "page436"> </a>
<p>Here all depends on what is meant by <i>mind</i> and by
<i>identical</i>. Does Mr. Darwin mean by “mind” something
substantial&mdash;an agent that deals with the impressions received
through the senses, as a builder deals with his bricks? Then, according
to his father’s view, the one builder may build a mere hovel, the other
may erect a cathedral, but through their descent they are substantially
the same. Or does he mean by “mind,” the mode and manner in which
sensations are received and arranged, what one might call, in fact, the
law of sensuous gravitation? Then I say again, according to his father’s
view, that law is substantially the same for animal and man. Nor is this
a conclusion derived from Mr. Darwin’s premises against his will. It is
the opinion strongly advocated by him. He has collected the most
interesting observations on the incipient germs, not only of language,
but of æsthetics and ethics, among animals. If Mr. Darwin, Jr., holds
that the mind of man is not substantially identical with the animal
mind, if he admits a break somewhere in the ascending scale from the
Protogenes to the first Man, then we should be driven to the old
conclusion&mdash;viz., that man was formed of the dust of the ground,
but that God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man
became a living soul. Does Mr. Darwin, Jr., accept this?</p>

<p>Next it is said, that by a similar argument the distinction between
black and white, hot and cold, a&nbsp;high and a low note might be
eliminated. This sounds no doubt formidable&mdash;it almost looks like a
logical skeleton. But let us not be frightened by words. Black and white
are no doubt as different as possible, so are hot and cold, a&nbsp;high
and a low note.
<span class = "pagenum">437</span>
<a name = "page437" id = "page437"> </a>
But what is the difference between a high and a low note? It is simply
the smaller or larger number of vibrations in a given time. We can count
these vibrations, and we also know that, from time to time, as the
velocity of the vibrations increases, our dull senses can distinguish
new tones. We have therefore here to deal with differences that used to
be called differences of degree, as opposed to differences in kind. What
applies to a low and a high note, applies to a low and high degree of
heat, and to the various degrees of light which we call by the names of
colors. In all these cases, what philosophers call the substance,
remains the same, just as, according to evolutionists, the substance of
man and animal is the same. Therefore, if man differs from an animal no
more than a high note differs from a low, or, <i>vice versâ</i>, if a
high note differs no more from a low than man differs from an ape, my
argument would seem to stand in spite of the shower of words poured over
it.</p>

<p>I myself referred to the difference between a high and a low note for
a totally different purpose, viz., in order to call attention to those
strange lines and limits in nature which, in spite of insensible
graduation, enable us to distinguish broad degrees of sound which we
call keys; broad degrees of light, which we call colors; broad degrees
of heat, for which our language has a less perfect nomenclature. These
lines and limits have never been explained, nor the higher limits which
separate sound from light, and light from heat. Why we should derive
pleasure from the exact number of vibrations which yield C, and then
have painful sensations till we come to the exact number of vibrations
which yield C sharp,
<span class = "pagenum">438</span>
<a name = "page438" id = "page438"> </a>
remains as yet a mystery. But as showing that nature had drawn these
sharp lines across the continuous stream of vibrations, whether of sound
or light, seemed to me an important problem, particularly for
evolutionist philosophers, who see in nature nothing but “insensible
graduation.”</p>

<p>The next charge brought against me is, that I overlook the undoubted
and undisputed fact that species do actually vary in nature. This seems
to me begging the whole question. If terms like <i>species</i> are
fetched from the lumber-room of scholastic philosophy, they must be
defined with logical exactness, particularly at present, when the very
existence of such a thing as a <i>species</i> depends on the meaning
which we assign to it. Nature gives us individuals only, and each
individual differs from the other. But “species” is a thing of <i>human
workmanship</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVIII_5" id = "tagVIII_5"
href = "#noteVIII_5">5</a> and it depends entirely on the disputed
definition of the term, whether species vary or not. In one sense, Mr.
Darwin’s book, “On the Origin of Species,” may be called an attempt to
repeal the term “species,” or, at all events, an attempt at giving a new
definition to that word which it never had before. No one appreciates
more than I do the service he has rendered in calling forth a new
examination of that old and somewhat rusty instrument of thought.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVIII_6" id = "tagVIII_6" href =
"#noteVIII_6">6</a> Only, do not let us take for granted what has to be
proved.</p>

<p>The dust of words grows thicker and thicker as we go on, for I am
next told that the same line of proof would show “that the stature of a
man or boy was identical, because the boy passes through every gradation
<span class = "pagenum">439</span>
<a name = "page439" id = "page439"> </a>
on attaining the one stature from the other. No one could maintain such
a position who grasped the doctrines of continuity and of the
differential calculus.” It seems to me that even without the help of the
differential calculus, we can, with the help of logic and grammar, put a
stop to this argument. Boy is the subject, stature looks like a subject,
but is merely a predicate, and should have been treated as such by Mr.
Darwin. If a boy arrives by insensible graduation or growth at the
stature of man, the man is substantially the same as the boy. His
stature may be different, the color of his hair may be so likewise; but
what philosophers used to call the substance, or the individuality, or
the personality, or what we may call the man, remains the same. If
evolutionists really maintain that the difference between man and beast
is the same as between a grown-up man and a boy, the whole of my
argument is granted, and granted with a completeness which I had no
right to expect. Will Mr. Darwin, Senior, indorse the concessions thus
made by Mr. Darwin, Junior?</p>

<p>In order to show how the simplest matters can be complicated by a
free use of scholastic terms, I&nbsp;quote the following sentence, which
is meant as an answer to my argument:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“According to what is called the Darwinian theory, organisms are in fact
precisely the result of a multiple integration of a complex function of
a very great number of variables; many of such variables being bound
together by relationships amongst themselves, an example of one such
relationship being afforded by the law, which has been called
‘correlation of growth.’”</p>

<p>Next follows a rocket from Mr. Whitney’s armory:&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">440</span>
<a name = "page440" id = "page440"> </a>
<p class = "quote">
“As a linguist,” he says, “Professor Müller claims to have found in
language an endowment which has no analogies, and no preparations in
even the beings nearest to man, and of which, therefore, no process of
transmutation could furnish an explanation. Here is the pivot on which
his whole argument rests and revolves.”</p>

<p>So far, the statement is correct, only that I expressed myself a
little more cautiously. It is well known, that the animals which in
other respects come nearest to man, possess very imperfect phonetic
organs, and that it would be improper, therefore, to refer more
particularly to them. But, however that may be, I&nbsp;expected at all
events some proof that I had made a mistake, that my argument jars, or
my pivot gives. But nothing of the kind. No facts, no arguments, but
simply an assertion that I do not argue the case with moderation and
acuteness, on strict scientific grounds, and by scientific methods in
setting up language as the specific difference between man and animals.
And why? Because many other writers have adduced other differences as
<i>the</i> correct ones.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of purely explosive matter in these vague
charges of want of moderation and acuteness. But what is the kernel?
I&nbsp;represented language as the specific difference between man and
animals, without mentioning other differences which others believe to be
specific. It would seem to show moderation rather than the absence of
it, if I confined myself to language, to the study of which I have
devoted the whole of my life; and perhaps a certain acuteness, in not
touching on questions which I do not pretend to have studied, as they
ought to be. But there were other reasons, too, which made me
<span class = "pagenum">441</span>
<a name = "page441" id = "page441"> </a>
look upon language as <i>the</i> specific difference. The so-called
specific differences mentioned by others fall into two
classes&mdash;those that are implied by language, as I defined the word,
and those which have been proved untenable by Mr. Darwin and others. Let
us read on now, to see what these specific differences are:&mdash;</p>

<p>Did it show then such want of moderation or acuteness if I confined
myself to language, and what is implied by language, as the specific
difference between man and beast? Really, one sometimes yearns for an
adversary who can hit straight, instead of these random strokes page
after page.</p>

<p>The next attack is so feeble that I should gladly pass it by, did I
not know from past experience that the very opposite motive would be
assigned to my doing so. I&nbsp;had stated that if there is a <i>terra
incognita</i> which excludes all positive knowledge, it is the mind of
animals. How, then, I&nbsp;am asked, do you know that no animal
possesses the faintest germs of the faculty of abstracting and
generalizing, and that animals receive their knowledge through the
senses only? I&nbsp;still recollect the time when any philosopher who,
even by way of illustration, ventured to appeal to the mind of animals,
was simply tabooed, and I thought every student of the history of
philosophy would have understood what I meant by saying that the whole
subject was transcendent. However, here is my answer: I&nbsp;hold that
animals receive their knowledge through the senses, because I can apply
a crucial test, and show that if I shut their eyes, they cannot see. And
I hold that they are without the faculty of abstracting and
generalizing, because I have here nothing before me but mere assertions,
I&nbsp;know of no crucial test to prove that these assertions are true.
Those who have read my Lectures, and were able to reduce them to a
skeleton of logical statement, might have seen that I had adduced
another
<span class = "pagenum">443</span>
<a name = "page443" id = "page443"> </a>
reason, viz., the fact that general conceptions are impossible without
language (using language in the widest sense, so as to include
hieroglyphic, numerical, and other signs), and that as no one has yet
discovered any outward traces of language among animals, we are
justified in not ascribing to them, as yet, the possession of abstract
ideas. This seems to me to explain fully “why the same person (viz., my
poor self) should be involved in such profound ignorance, and yet have
so complete a knowledge of the limits of the animal mind.” If I had said
that man has five senses, and no more, would that be wrong? Yet having
myself only five senses, I&nbsp;could not possibly prove that other men
may not have a sixth sense, or at all events a disposition to develop
it. But I am quite willing to carry my agnosticism, with regard to the
inner life of animals, still further, and to say again what I wrote in
my Lectures (p.&nbsp;46):&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“I say again and again, that according to the strict rules of positive
philosophy, we have no right either to assert or to deny anything with
reference to the so-called mind of animals.”</p>

<p>But there is another piece of Chinese artillery brought out by Mr. G.
Darwin. As if not trusting it himself, he calls on Mr. Whitney to fire
it off&mdash;“The minds of our fellow men, too,” we are told, “are a
<i>terra incognita</i> in exactly the same sense as are those of
animals.”</p>

<p>No student of psychology would deny that each individual has
immediate knowledge of his own mind only, but even Mr. G. Darwin reminds
Mr. Whitney that, after all, with man we have one additional source of
evidence&mdash;viz., language; nay, he even doubts whether there may not
be others, too. If Mr. Darwin, Jr., grants that, I&nbsp;willingly grant
him that the
<span class = "pagenum">444</span>
<a name = "page444" id = "page444"> </a>
horse’s impression of green&mdash;nay, my friend’s impression of
green&mdash;may be totally different from my own, to say nothing of
Daltonism, color-blindness, and all the rest.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVIII_7" id = "tagVIII_7" href = "#noteVIII_7">7</a></p>

<p>After this, I need hardly dwell on the old attempts at proving, by a
number of anecdotes, that animals possess conceptual knowledge. The
anecdotes are always amusing, and are sure to meet with a grateful
public, but for our purpose they have long been ruled out of court. If
Mr. Darwin, Jr., should ever pass through Oxford, I&nbsp;promise to show
him in my own dog, Waldmann, far more startling instances of sagacity
than any he has mentioned, though I am afraid he will be confirmed all
the more in his anthropomorphic interpretation of canine
intelligence.</p>

<p>Now comes a new appeal <i>ad populum</i>. I had ventured to say that
in our days nothing was more strongly to be recommended to young and old
philosophers than a study of the history of philosophy. There is a
continuity, not only in Nature, but also in the progress of the human
mind; and to ignore that continuity, to begin always like Thales or
Democritus, is like having a special creation every day. Evolutionists
seem to imagine that there is evolution for everything, except for
evolutionism. What would chemists say, if every young student began
again with the theory of a phlogiston, or every geologist with
Vulcanism, or every astronomer with the Ptolemæic system? However,
I&nbsp;did not go back very far; I&nbsp;only claimed a little
consideration for the work done by such giants as Locke, Hume, Berkeley,
and Kant. I&nbsp;expressed a hope that certain questions might be
considered as closed, or, if they were to be
<span class = "pagenum">445</span>
<a name = "page445" id = "page445"> </a>
re-opened, that at least the controversy should be taken up where it was
left at the end of the last debate. Here, however, I&nbsp;failed to make
any impression. My appeal is stigmatized as “an attempt to crush my
adversaries by a reference to Kant, Hume, Berkeley, and Locke.” And the
popular tribune finishes with the following brave words: “Fortunately we
live in an age, which (except for temporary relapses) does not pay any
great attention to the pious founders, and which tries to judge for
itself.”</p>

<p>I never try to crush my adversaries by deputy. Kant, Hume, Berkeley,
and Locke may all be antiquated for all I know; but I still hold it
would be useful to read them, before we declare too emphatically that we
have left them behind.</p>

<p>I cannot deny myself the satisfaction of quoting on this point the
wise and weighty words of Huxley:&mdash;</p>

title = "text reads ‘io’">to</ins> look at the past, and even grow into
the habit of neglecting it. But, natural as this result may be, it is
none the less detrimental. The intellect loses, for there is assuredly
no more effectual method of clearing up one’s own mind on any subject
than by talking it over, so to speak, with men of real power and grasp
who have considered it from a totally different point of view. The
parallax of time helps us to the true position of a conception, as the
parallax of space helps us to that of a star. And the moral nature loses
no less. It is well to turn aside from the fretful stir of the present,
and to dwell with gratitude and respect upon the services of those
mighty men of old who have gone down to the grave with their weapons of
war, but who, while they yet lived, won splendid victories over
ignorance.”</p>

<p>Next follow some extraordinary efforts on Mr. Whitney’s part to show
that Locke, whose arguments I had simply re-stated, knew very little
about human or animal understanding, and then the threadbare argument of
the deaf and dumb is brushed up once more. Until something new is said
on that old subject, I&nbsp;must be allowed to remain myself deaf and
dumb.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVIII_8" id = "tagVIII_8" href =

<p>Then comes the final and decisive charge. I had said that “if the
science of language has proved anything, it has proved that conceptual
or discursive thought can be carried on in words only.” Here again I had
quoted a strong array of authorities&mdash;not, indeed, to kill free
inquiry&mdash;I am not so bloodthirsty, as my friends imagine&mdash;but
to direct it to those channels where it had been carried on before.
I&nbsp;quoted Locke, I&nbsp;quoted Schelling, Hegel, Wilhelm von
Humboldt, Schopenhauer, and Mansel&mdash;philosophers diametrically
opposed to each other on many points, yet all agreeing in what seems to
many so strange a doctrine, that conceptual thought is impossible
without language (comprehending by language hieroglyphic, numerical, and
similar symbols). I&nbsp;might have quoted many other thinkers and
poets. Professor Huxley seems clearly to have seen the difference
between trains of thought and trains of feelings. “Brutes,” he says,
“though, from the absence of language, they can have no trains of
thoughts, but only trains of feelings, yet have a consciousness which,
more or less distinctly, foreshadows our own.” And who could express the
right view of language more beautifully than Jean Paul?&mdash;</p>

<p>Having discussed that question very fully in my Lectures, I shall
attempt no more at present than to show that the objections raised by
Mr. Darwin, Jr., entirely miss the point. Does he really think that
those men could have spent all their lives in considering that question,
and never have been struck by the palpable objections raised by him? Let
us treat such neighbors, at least like ourselves. I&nbsp;shall, however,
do my best to show Mr. Darwin that even I had not been ignorant of these
objections. I&nbsp;shall follow him through every point, and, for fear
of misrepresenting him, quote his own words:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“(1) Concepts may be formed, and yet not put before the consciousness of
the conceiver, so that he ‘realizes’ what he is doing.”</p>

<p>Does that mean that the conceiver conceives concepts without
conceiving them? Then, I&nbsp;ask, whom do these concepts belong to,
where are they, and under what conditions were they realized? Is to
conceive an active or a passive verb? May I once more quote Kant without
incurring the suspicion of wishing to strangle free inquiry by
authority? “Concepts,” says the old veteran, “are founded on the
spontaneity of thought, sensuous intuitions on the receptivity of
impressions.”</p>

<p class = "quote">
“(2) Complex thoughts are doubtless impossible without symbols, just as
are the higher mathematics?”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">448</span>
<a name = "page448" id = "page448"> </a>
<p>Are lower mathematics possible without numerical symbols, and where
is the line which separates complex from simple thought? Everything
would seem to depend on that line which is so often spoken of by our
critics. There ought to be something in that line which would at once
remove the blunders committed by Humboldt and others. It would define
the limit between inarticulate and articulate thought; it might possibly
be the very frontier between the animal and the human mind, and yet that
magic line is simply conceived, spoken of freely, but never realized,
<i>i.e.</i>, never traced with logical precision. Till that is done,
that line, though it may exist, is to me as if it did not exist.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“(3) We know that dogs doubt and hesitate, and finally determine to act
without any external determining circumstance.”</p>

<p>How this argument fits in here, is not quite clear to me; but,
whatever its drift may be, a&nbsp;perusal of Professor Huxley’s
excellent paper, “The Hypothesis that Animals are Automata,” will supply
a full answer.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“(4) Professor Whitney very happily illustrates the independence of
thought from language, by calling up our state of mind when casting
about, often in the most open manner, for new designations, for new
forms of knowledge, or when drawing distinctions, and pointing
conclusions, which words are then stretched or narrowed to cover.”</p>

<p>Language with us has become so completely traditional, that we
frequently learn words first and their meaning afterwards. The problem
of the original relation between concepts and words, however, refers to
periods when these words did not yet exist, but had to be framed for the
first time. We are
<span class = "pagenum">449</span>
<a name = "page449" id = "page449"> </a>
speaking of totally different things; he, of the geology, I, if I may
say so, of the chemistry of speech. But even if we accepted the test
from modern languages, does not the very form of the question supply the
answer? If we want <i>new</i> designations, <i>new</i> forms of
knowledge, do we not confess that we have old designations, though
imperfect ones; old forms of knowledge which no longer answer our
purpose? Our old words, then, become gradually stretched or narrowed,
exactly as our knowledge becomes stretched or narrowed, or we at last
throw away the old word, and borrow another from our own, or even from a
foreign language.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“It is a proof,” Mr. Darwin says, “that we realized and conceived the
idea of the texture and nature of a musical sound before we had a word
for it, that we had to borrow the expressive word “<i>timbre</i>” from
the French.”</p>

<p>But how did we realize and conceive the idea before we had a word for
it? Surely, by old words. We called it quality, texture, nature&mdash;we
knew it as the result of the presence and absence of various harmonics.
In German, we stretched an old word, and called it <i>Farbe</i>; in
English, <i>timbre</i> was borrowed from the French, just as we may call
a pound <i>vingt-cinq francs</i>; but the French themselves got their
word by the ordinary process&mdash;viz., by stretching the old word,
<i>tympanum</i>.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“(5) If Müller had brought before him some wholly new animal he would
find that he could shut his eyes, and call up the image of it readily
enough without any accompanying name.”</p>

<p>All this is far, far away from the real field of battle. No doubt, if
I look at the sun and shut my eyes, the image remains for a time. By
imagination
<span class = "pagenum">450</span>
<a name = "page450" id = "page450"> </a>
I can also recall other sensuous impressions, and, in an attack of
fever, I&nbsp;have had sensuous impressions resuscitated without my
will. But how does that touch conceptual knowledge? As soon as I want to
know what animal it is which I conjure up or imagine to myself,
I&nbsp;must either have, for shortness’ sake, its scientific name, or I
must conceive and realize its ears, or its legs, or its tail, or
something else, but always something for which there is a name.</p>

<p>I have thus, in spite of the old warning, <i>Ne Hercules contra
duos</i>, gone through the whole string of charges brought against me by
Mr. Darwin and Professor Whitney; and while trying to show them that I
was not entirely unprepared for their combined attack, I&nbsp;hope I
have not been wanting in that respect which is due even to a somewhat
rancorous assailant. I&nbsp;have not returned evil for evil, nor have I
noticed objections which I could not refute without seeming to be
offensive. Is it not mere skirmishing with blank cartridge, when
Professor Whitney assures me that I have never fathomed “the theory of
the antecedency of the idea to the word in the minds of those who hold
that theory?” Surely, that is the theory which everybody holds who forms
his idea of the origin of language from the manner in which we acquire a
traditional language ready made, or, later in life, learn foreign
languages. It has been my object to show that our problem is not, how
languages are learnt, but how language is developed. We might as well
form our ideas of the origin of the alphabet from the manner in which we
learn to write, and then smile when we are told that, in writing “F” we
still draw in the two upper strokes, the two horns of the
<i>cerastes</i>, and that the connecting line in the “H”
<span class = "pagenum">451</span>
<a name = "page451" id = "page451"> </a>
is the last remnant of the lines dividing the sieve, both hieroglyphics
occurring in the name of Chufu or Cheops.</p>

<p>Philosophy is a study as much as philology, and though common sense
is, no doubt, very valuable within its proper limits, I&nbsp;do not
hesitate to say, though I hear already the distant grumbling of
<i>Jupiter tonans</i>, that it is generally the very opposite of
philosophy. One of the most eminent and most learned of living German
philosophers&mdash;Professor Carriere, of Munchen&mdash;says in a very
friendly review of Professor Whitney’s “Lectures on Language”&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Philosophical depth and precision in psychological analysis are not his
strong points, and in that respect the reader will hardly find anything
new in his Lectures.”</p>

<p>He goes on to say that&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“The American scholar did not see that language is meant first for
forming, afterwards for communicating thought.” “Wordmaking,” he says
with great truth, “is the first philosophy&mdash;the first poetry of
mankind. We can have sensations, desires, intentions, but we cannot
think, in the proper sense of the word, without language. Every word
expresses the general. Mr. Whitney has not understood this, and his
calling language a human institution is very shallow.”</p>

<p>Against Professor Whitney’s view that language is arbitrary and
conventional, and against the opposite view that language is
instinctive, Professor Carriere quotes the happy expression of
M.&nbsp;Renan, “<i>La liaison du sens et du mot n’est jamais nécessaire,
jamais arbitraire, toujours elle est motivée.</i>” Here the nail is hit
on the head. Professor Carriero highly commends Professor Whitney’s
lectures, and he does by no means adopt all my own views; but he felt
<span class = "pagenum">452</span>
<a name = "page452" id = "page452"> </a>
obliged to enter a protest against certain journalistic proceedings
which in Germany have attracted general attention.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if I may judge from Professor Whitney’s lectures,
unless he has changed very much of late, I&nbsp;doubt whether he would
prove a real ally of Mr. Darwin in his views on the origin of language.
Towards the end of his article, even Mr. Darwin, Jr., becomes
suspicious. Professor Whitney, he says, makes a dangerous assertion when
he says that we shall never know anything of the transitional forms
through which language has passed, and he advises his friend to read a
book lately published by Count G.&nbsp;A. de Goddesand Liancourt and
F.&nbsp;Pincott, called “Primitive and Universal Laws of Language,” in
which he would find much information and enlightenment on the real
origin of roots. There is an unintentional irony in that advice which
Professor Whitney will not fail to appreciate. How any one who cares for
truth can speak of a dangerous assertion, I&nbsp;do not understand. The
Pope may say so, or a barrister; a&nbsp;true friend of truth knows of no
danger.</p>

<p>In his “Lectures on Language,” Professor Whitney protests strongly
against Darwinian materialism. But, as he confesses himself half a
convert to the <i>Bow-wow</i> and <i>Pooh-pooh</i> theories, thus
showing how wrong I was in supposing that those theories had no
advocates among comparative philologists in the nineteenth century; nay,
as now, after he has discovered at last that I am no believer in
<i>Ding-dongism</i>, he seems inclined to say a kind word for the
advocates of that theory&mdash;Heyse and Steinthal&mdash;who knows
whether, after my Lectures on Darwin’s “Philosophy
<span class = "pagenum">453</span>
<a name = "page453" id = "page453"> </a>
of Language,” he may not be converted by Bleek and Haeckel, the mad
Darwinian, as he calls him?</p>

<p>All this, no doubt, has its humorous side, and I have tried to answer
it good-humoredly. But it seems to me that it also has a very serious
import. Why is there all this wrangling as to whether man is the
descendant of a lower animal or not? Why cannot people examine the
question in a temper more consonant with a real love of truth? Why look
for artificial barriers between man and beast, if they are not there?
Why try to remove real barriers, if they are there? Surely we shall
remain what we are, whatever befall. When we throw the question back
into a very distant antiquity, all seems to grow confused and out of
focus. Yet time and space make little difference in the solution of
these problems. Let us see what exists to-day. We see to-day that the
lowest of savages&mdash;men whose language is said to be no better than
the clucking of hens, or the twittering of birds, and who have been
declared in many respects lower even than animals, possess this one
specific characteristic, that if you take one of their babies, and bring
it up in England, it will learn to speak as well as any English baby,
while no amount of education will elicit any attempts at language from
the highest animals, whether bipeds or quadrupeds. That disposition
cannot have, been formed by definite nervous structures, congenitally
framed, for we are told by the best Agriologists that both father and
mother clucked like hens. This fact, therefore, unless disproved by
experiment, remains, whatever the explanation may be.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, then, that myriads of years ago there was, out of
myriads of animal beings, one, and
<span class = "pagenum">454</span>
<a name = "page454" id = "page454"> </a>
one only, which made that step which in the end led to language, while
the whole rest of the creation remained behind;&mdash;what would follow?
That one being then, like the savage baby now, must have possessed
something of his own&mdash;a germ very imperfect, it may be, yet found
nowhere else, and that germ, that capacity, that disposition&mdash;call
it what you like&mdash;is, and always will remain the specific
difference of himself and all his descendants. It makes no difference
whether we say it came of itself, or it was due to environment, or it
was the gift of a Being in whom we live and move. All these are but
different expressions for the Unknown. If that germ of the Logos had to
pass through thousands of forms, from the Protogenes to Adam, before it
was fit to fulfill its purpose, what is that to us? It was there
<i>potentiâ</i> from the beginning; it manifested itself where it was,
in the paulo-post-future man; it never manifested itself where it was
not, in any of the creatures that were animals from the beginning, and
remained so to the end.</p>

<p>Surely, even if all scholastic philosophy must now be swept away, if
to be able to reduce all the wisdom of the past to a <i>tabula rasa</i>
is henceforth to be the test of a true philosopher, a&nbsp;few landmarks
may still be allowed to remain, and we may venture to quote, for
instance, <i>Ex nihilo nihil fit</i>, without being accused of trying to
crush free inquiry by an appeal to authority. Language is something, it
pre-supposes something; and that which it pre-supposes, that from which
it sprang, whatever its pre-historic, pre-mundane, pre-cosmic state may
have been, must have been different from that from which it did not
spring. People ask whether that germ of language
<span class = "pagenum">455</span>
<a name = "page455" id = "page455"> </a>
was “slowly evolved,” or “divinely implanted,” but if they would but lay
a firm grip on their words and thoughts, they would see that these two
expressions, which have been made the watchwords of two hostile camps,
differ from each other dialectically only.</p>

<p>That there is in us an animal&mdash;aye, a bestial nature&mdash;has
never been denied; to deny it would take away the very foundation of
Psychology and Ethics. We cannot be reminded too often that all the
materials of our knowledge we share with animals; that, like them, we
begin with sensuous impressions, and then, like ourselves, and like
ourselves only, proceed to the General, the Ideal, the Eternal. We
cannot be reminded too often that in many things we are like the beasts
of the field, but that, like ourselves, and like ourselves only, we can
rise superior to our bestial self, and strive after what is Unselfish,
Good, and God-like. The wing by which we soar above the Sensuous, was
called by wise men of old the <i>Logos</i>; the wing which lifts us
above the Sensual, was called by good men of old the <i>Daimonion</i>.
Let us take continual care, especially within the precincts of the
Temple of Science, lest by abusing the gift of speech or doing violence
to the voice of conscience, we soil the two wings of our soul, and fall
back, through our own fault, to the dreaded level of the Gorilla.</p>

IN SELF-DEFENSE.</h3>

<h5>PRESENT STATE OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES.</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">It</span> has been remarked by many
observers that in all branches of physical as well as historical
learning there is at the present moment a strongly pronounced tendency
towards special researches. No one can hold his own among his
fellow-workers who cannot point to some discovery, however small, to
some observation, to some decipherings, to some edition of a text
hitherto unpublished, or, at least, to some conjectural readings which
are, in the true sense of the word, his property. A&nbsp;man must now
have served from the ranks before he is admitted to act as a general,
and not even Darwin or Mommsen would have commanded general attention
for their theories on the ancient history of Rome, or on the primitive
development of animal life, unless they had been known for years as
sturdy workers in their respective quarries.</p>

<p>On the whole, I believe that this state of public opinion has
produced a salutary effect, but it has also its dangers. An army that
means conquest, cannot always depend on its scouts and pioneers, nor
must it be broken up altogether into single detachments of tirailleurs.
From time to time, it has to make a combined movement in advance, and
for that purpose
<span class = "pagenum">457</span>
<a name = "page457" id = "page457"> </a>
it wants commanders who know the general outlines of the battle-field,
and are familiar with the work that can best be done by each branch of
the service.</p>


<h5>EVOLUTIONISM.</h5>

<p>If we look upon scholars, historians, students of physical science,
and abstract philosophers, as so many branches of the great army of
knowledge which has been fighting its way for centuries for the conquest
of truth, it might be said, if we may follow up our comparison a little
further, that the light cavalry of physical science had lately made a
quick movement in advance, and detached itself too much from the support
of the infantry and heavy artillery. The charge was made against the old
impregnable fortress, the Origin of Life, and to judge from the
victorious hurrahs of the assaulting squadron, we might have thought
that a breach had at last been effected, and that the keys to the long
hidden secrets of creation and development had been surrendered. As the
general commanding this attack, we all recognize Mr. Darwin, supported
by a brilliant staff of dashing officers, and if ever general was well
chosen for victory, it was the author of the “Origin of Species.”</p>

<p>There was indeed for a time a sanguine hope, shared by many a brave
soldier, that the old warfare of the world would, in our time, be
crowned with success, that we should know at last what we are, whence we
came, and whither we go; that, beginning with the simplest elementary
substances, we should be able to follow the process of combination and
division, leading by numberless and imperceptible changes from the
lowest Bathybios to the highest Hypsibios, and that we should succeed in
establishing
<span class = "pagenum">458</span>
<a name = "page458" id = "page458"> </a>
by incontrovertible facts what old sages had but guessed, viz., that
there is nowhere anything hard and specific in nature, but all is
flowing and growing, without an efficient cause or a determining
purpose, under the sway of circumstances only, or of a self-created
environment. <span class = "greek" title = "Panta rhei.">Πάντα
ῥεῖ.</span></p>

<p>But that hope is no longer so loudly and confidently expressed as it
was some years ago. For a time all seemed clear and simple. We began
with Protoplasm, which anybody might see at the bottom of the sea,
developing into Moneres, and we ended with the bimanous mammal called
<i>Homo</i>, whether <i>sapiens</i> or <i>insipiens</i>, everything
between the two being matter of imperceptible development.</p>


<h5>DIFFICULTIES IN EVOLUTIONISM.</h5>

<p>The difficulties began where they generally begin, at the beginning
and at the end. <i>Protoplasm</i> was a name that produced at first a
soothing effect on the inquisitive mind, but when it was asked, whence
that power of development, possessed by the Protoplasm which begins as a
Moneres and ends as Homo, but entirely absent in other Protoplasm, which
resists all mechanical manipulation, and never enters upon organic
growth, it was seen that the problem of development had not been solved,
but only shifted, and that, instead of simple Protoplasm, very peculiar
kinds of Protoplasm were required, which under circumstances might
become and remain a Moneres, and under circumstances might become and
remain <i>Homo</i> forever. That which determined Protoplasm to enter
upon its marvelous career, the first <span class = "greek" title =
"kinoun akinêton">κινοῦν ἀκινητόν</span>, remained as unknown as ever.
It was open to call it an internal and unconscious, or an external and
conscious
<span class = "pagenum">459</span>
<a name = "page459" id = "page459"> </a>
power, or both together: physical, metaphysical, and religious mythology
were left as free as ever. The best proof of this we find in the fact
that Mr. Darwin himself retained his belief in a personal Creator, while
Haeckel denies all necessity of admitting a conscious agent; and Von
Hartmann<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX_1" id = "tagIX_1" href =
"#noteIX_1">1</a> sees in what is called the philosophy of evolutionism
the strongest confirmation of idealism, “all development being in truth
but the realization of the unconscious reason of the creative idea.”</p>


<h5>GLOTTOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONISM.</h5>

<p>While the difficulty at the beginning consists in this that, after
all, nothing can be developed except what was enveloped, the difficulty
at the end is this that something is supposed to be developed that was
not enveloped. It was here where I thought it became my duty to draw Mr.
Darwin’s attention to difficulties which he had not suspected at all, or
which, at all events, he had allowed himself to under-value. Mr. Darwin
had tried to prove that there was nothing to prevent us from admitting a
possible transition from the brute to man, as far as their physical
structure was concerned, and it was natural that he should wish to
believe that the same applied to their mental capacities. Now, whatever
difference of opinion there might be among philosophers as to the
classification and naming of these capacities, and as to any rudimentary
traces of them to be discovered in animals, there had always been a
universal consent that language was a distinguishing characteristic of
man. Without inquiring what was implied by
<span class = "pagenum">460</span>
<a name = "page460" id = "page460"> </a>
language, so much was certain, that language was something tangible,
present in every man, absent in every brute. Nothing, therefore, was
more natural than that Mr. Darwin should wish to show that this was an
error: that language was nothing specific in man, but had its
antecedents, however imperfect, in the signs of communication among
animals. Influenced, no doubt, by the works of some of his friends and
relatives on the origin of language, he thought that it had been proved
that our words could be derived <i>directly</i> from imitative and
interjectional sounds. If the Science of Language has proved anything,
it has proved that this is not the case. We know that, with certain
exceptions, about which there can be little controversy, all our words
are derived from roots, and that every one of these roots is the
expression of a general concept. “Without roots, no language; without
concepts, no roots,” these are the two pillars on which our philosophy
of language stands, and with which it falls.</p>


<h5>MR. WEDGWOOD’S DICTIONARY.</h5>

<p>Any word taken from Mr. Wedgwood’s Dictionary will show the
difference between those who derive words <i>directly</i> from imitative
and interjectional sounds, and those who do not. For instance, s.v.
<i>to plunge</i>, we read:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Fr. <i>plonger</i> Du. <i>plotsen</i>, <i>plonssen</i>, <i>plonzen</i>,
to fall into the water&mdash;Kil.; <i>plotsen</i>, also to fall suddenly
on the ground. The origin, like that of <i>plump</i>, is a
representation of the noise made by the fall. Swiss <i>bluntschen</i>,
the sound of a thick heavy body falling into the water.” Under
<i>plump</i> we read, “that the radical image is the sound made by a
compact body falling into the water, or of a mass of wet falling to the
ground. <i>He smit den sten in’t water, plump! seg dat</i>, ‘He threw
the stone into the
<span class = "pagenum">461</span>
<a name = "page461" id = "page461"> </a>
water; it cried plump!’ <i>Plumpen</i>, to make the noise represented by
plump, to fall with such a noise, etc., etc., etc.”</p>

<p>All this sounds extremely plausible, and to a man not specially
conversant with linguistic studies, far more plausible than the real
etymology of the word. To plunge is, no doubt, as Mr. Wedgwood says, the
French <i>plonger</i> but the French <i>plonger</i> is
<i>plumbicare</i>, while in Italian <i>piombare</i> is <i>cadere a
piombo</i>, to fall straight like the plummet. To plunge, therefore, has
nothing to do with the splashing sound of heavy bodies falling into the
water, but with the concept of straightness, here symbolized by the
plummet.</p>

<p>This case, however, would only show the disregard of historical facts
with which the onomatopœic school has been so frequently and so justly
charged. But as we cannot trace <i>plumbum</i>, or <span class = "greek"
title = "molubos">μόλυβος</span>, or Old Slav. <i>olovo</i> with any
certainty to a root such as <i>mal</i>, to be soft, let us take another
word, such as <i>feather</i>. Here, again, we find that Mr. Wedgwood
connects it with such words as Bav. <i>fledern</i>, Du. <i>vlederen</i>,
to flap, flutter, the loss of the <i>l</i> being explained by such words
as to splutter and to sputter. We have first to note the disregard of
historical facts, for <i>feather</i> is O.H.G. <i>fedara</i>, Sk.
pat-tra, Gr. <span class = "greek" title = "pteron">πτερόν</span> for
<span class = "greek" title = "peteron">πετερον</span>, all derived from
a root <i>pat</i>, to fly, from which we have also <i>penna</i>, old
<i>pesna</i>, <span class = "greek" title = "pet-omai">πέτ-ομαι</span>,
<i>peto</i>, <i>impetus</i>, etc. The root <i>pat</i> expresses violent
motion, and it is specialized into upward motion, <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads πέτομα [petoma] for [petomai]">πέτομαι</ins>, I fly; downward motion, Sk. <em>patati</em>,
he falls; and onward motion, as in Latin <i>peto</i>, <i>impetus</i>,
etc. Feather, therefore, as derived from this root, was conceived as the
instrument of flying, and was never intended to imitate the noise of Du.
<i>vlederen</i>, to flutter, and to flap.<!-- so take THAT mr. wedgwood!

<h5>MY LECTURES ON MR. DARWIN’S PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE.</h5>

<p>As this want of historical treatment among onomatopœic philologists
has frequently been dwelt on by myself and others, these instances may
suffice to mark the difference between the school so ably and powerfully
represented by Mr. Wedgwood, and the school of Bopp, to which I and most
comparative philologists belong. It was in the name of that school that
I ventured to address my protest to the school of evolutionists,
reminding them of difficulties, which they had either ignored
altogether, or, at all events, greatly undervalued, and putting our case
before them in such a form that even philosophers, not conversant with
the special researches of philologists, might gain a clear insight into
the present state of our science, and form their opinion
accordingly.</p>

<p>In doing this I thought I was simply performing a duty which, in the
present state of divided and subdivided labor, has to be performed, if
we wish to prevent a useless waste of life. However different our
pursuits may be, we all belong, as I said before, to the same army, we
all have the same interests at heart, we are bound together by what the
French would call the strongest of all solidarities, the love of truth.
If I had thought only of my own fellow-laborers in the field of the
Science of Language, I&nbsp;should not have considered that there was
any necessity for the three Lectures which I delivered in 1873 at the
Royal Institution. In my first course of Lectures on the Science of
Language (1861), delivered before Evolutionism had assumed its present
dimensions, I&nbsp;had already expressed my conviction that language is
the one great barrier between the brute and man.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">463</span>
<a name = "page463" id = "page463"> </a>
<p class = "quote">
“Man speaks,” I&nbsp;said, “and no brute has ever uttered a word.
Language is something more palpable than a fold of the brain or an angle
of the skull. It admits of no caviling, and no process of natural
selection will ever distill significant words out of the notes of birds
or the cries of beasts.”</p>

<p>No scholar, so far as I know, has ever controverted any of these
statements. But when Evolutionism became, as it fully deserved, the
absorbing interest of all students of nature, when it was supposed that,
if a Moneres could develop into a Man, Bow-wow and Pooh-pooh might well
have developed by imperceptible degrees into Greek and Latin,
I&nbsp;thought it was time to state the case for the Science of Language
and its bearing on some of the problems of Evolutionism more fully, and
I gladly accepted the invitation to lecture once more on this subject at
the Royal Institution in 1873. My object was no more than a statement of
facts, showing that the results of the Science of Language did not at
present tally with the results of Evolutionism, that words could no
longer be derived directly from imitative and interjectional sounds,
that between these sounds and the first beginnings of language, in the
technical sense of the word, a&nbsp;barrier had been discovered,
represented by what we call Roots, and that, as far as we know, no
attempt, not even the faintest, has ever been made by any animal, except
man, to approach or to cross that barrier. I&nbsp;went one step further.
I&nbsp;showed that Roots were with man the embodiments of general
concepts, and that the only way in which man realized general concepts,
was by means of those roots, and words derived from roots.
I&nbsp;therefore argued as follows: We do not know anything and cannot
possibly know anything of the mind of animals: therefore, the proper
<span class = "pagenum">464</span>
<a name = "page464" id = "page464"> </a>
attitude of the philosopher with regard to the mental capacities of
animals is one of complete neutrality. For all we know, the mental
capacities of animals may be of a higher order than our own, as their
sensuous capacities certainly are in many cases. All this, however, is
guesswork; one thing only is certain. If we are right that man realizes
his conceptual thought by means of words, derived from roots, and that
no animal possesses words derived from roots, it follows, not indeed,
that animals have no conceptual thought (in&nbsp;saying this,
I&nbsp;went too far), but that their conceptual thought is different in
its realized shape from our own.</p>

<p>From public and private discussions which followed the delivery of my
lectures at the Royal Institution (an&nbsp;abstract of them was
published in “Fraser’s Magazine,” and republished, I&nbsp;believe, in
America), it became clear to me that the object which I had in view had
been fully attained. General attention had been roused to the fact that
at all events the Science of Language had something to say in the matter
of Evolutionism, and I know that those whom it most concerned were
turning their thoughts in good earnest to the difficulties which I had
pointed out. I&nbsp;wanted no more, and I thought it best to let the
matter ferment for a time.</p>


<h5>MR. GEORGE DARWIN’S ARTICLE IN THE “CONTEMPORARY REVIEW.”</h5>

<p>But what was my <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘surpise’">surprise</ins> when I found that a gentleman who had acquired
considerable notoriety, not indeed by any special and original
researches in Comparative Philology, but by his repeated attempts at
vilifying the works of other scholars, Professor Whitney,
<span class = "pagenum">465</span>
<a name = "page465" id = "page465"> </a>
had sent a paper to Mr. Darwin, intended to throw discredit on the
statements which I had recommended to his serious consideration.
I&nbsp;did not know of that paper till an abstract of it appeared in the
“Contemporary Review,” signed George Darwin, and written with the avowed
purpose of discrediting the statements which I had made in my Lecture at
the Royal Institution. If Professor Whitney’s appeal had been addressed
to scholars only, I&nbsp;should gladly have left them to judge for
themselves. But as Mr. Darwin, Jr., was prevailed upon to stand sponsor
to Professor Whitney’s last production, and to lend to it, if not the
weight, at least the lustre of his name, I&nbsp;could not, without
appearing uncourteous, let it pass in silence. I&nbsp;am not one of
those who believe that truth is much advanced by public controversy, and
I have carefully eschewed it during the whole of my literary career. But
if I had left Professor Whitney’s assertions unanswered, I&nbsp;could
hardly have complained, if Mr. Darwin, Sr., and the many excellent
<i>savants</i> who share his views, had imagined that I had represented
the difficulties which the students of language feel with regard to
animals developing a language, in a false light; that in fact, instead
of wishing to assist, I&nbsp;had tried to impede the onward march of our
brave army. I&nbsp;have that faith in <span class = "greek" title = "hoi peri">οἱ περὶ</span> Darwin, that I believe they want honest advice,
from whatever quarter it may come, and I therefore was persuaded to
deviate for once from my usual course, and, by answering <i>seriatim</i>
every objection raised by Professor Whitney, to show that my advice had
been tendered <i>bonâ fide</i>, that I had not spoken in the character
of a special pleader, but simply and solely as a man of truth.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">466</span>
<a name = "page466" id = "page466"> </a>
<h5>MY ANSWER TO MR. DARWIN.</h5>

<p>My “Answer to Mr. Darwin” appeared in the “Contemporary Review” of
November, 1874, and if it had only elicited the letter which I received
from Mr. Darwin, Sr., I&nbsp;should have been amply repaid for the
trouble I had taken in the matter.</p>

<p>It produced, however, a still more important result, for it elicited
from the American assailant a hasty rejoinder, which opened the eyes
even of his best friends to the utter weakness of his case. Professor
Whitney, himself, had evidently not expected that I should notice his
assault. He had challenged me so often before, and I had never answered
him. Why, then, should I have replied now? My answer is, because, for
the first time, his charges had been countersigned by another.</p>

<p>I had not even read his books before, and he blames me severely for
that neglect, bluntly asking me, why I had not read them. That is indeed
a question extremely difficult to answer without appearing to be rude.
However, I&nbsp;may say this, that to know what books one must read, and
what books one may safely leave unread, is an art which, in these days
of literary fertility, every student has to learn. We know on the whole
what each scholar is doing, we know those who are engaged in special and
original work, and we are in duty bound to read whatever they write.
This in the present state of Comparative Philology, when independent
work is being done in every country of Europe, is as much as any man can
do, nay, often more than I feel able to do. But then, on the other hand,
we claim the liberty of leaving uncut other books in our science, which,
however
<span class = "pagenum">467</span>
<a name = "page467" id = "page467"> </a>
entertaining they may be in other respects, are not likely to contain
any new facts. In doing this, we run a risk, but we cannot help it.</p>

<p>And let me ask Professor Whitney, if by chance he had opened a book
and alighted on the following passage, would he have read much more?</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Take as instances <i>home</i> and <i>homely</i>, <i>scarce</i> and
<i>scarcely</i>, <i>direct</i> and <i>directly</i>, <i>lust</i> and
<i>lusty</i>, <i>naught</i> and <i>naughty</i>, <i>clerk</i> and
<i>clergy</i>, a <i>forge</i> and a <i>forgery</i>, <i>candid</i> and
<i>candidate</i>, <i>hospital</i> and <i>hospitality</i>, <i>idiom</i>
and <i>idiocy</i>, <i>alight</i> and <i>delight</i>, etc.”</p>

<p>Is there any philologist, comparative or otherwise, who does not know
that <i>light</i>, the Gothic <i>liuhath</i>, is connected with the
Latin <i>lucere</i>; that to <i>delight</i> is connected with Latin
<i>delector</i>, Old French <i>deleiter</i>, and with Latin
<i>de-lic-ere</i>; while to <i>alight</i> is of Teutonic origin, and
connected with Gothic <i>leihts</i>, Latin <i>levis</i>, Sanskrit
<i>laghus</i>?</p>

<p>But then, Professor Whitney continues, when at last he had forced me
to read some of his writings, why did I not read them carefully? Why did
I read Mr. Darwin’s article in the “Contemporary Review” only, and not
his own in an American journal?</p>

<p>Now here I feel somewhat guilty: still I can offer some excuse.
I&nbsp;did not read Professor Whitney’s reply in the American original,
first, because I could not get it in time; secondly, because I only felt
bound to answer the arguments which Mr. Darwin had adopted as his own.
Looking at the original article afterwards, I&nbsp;found that I had not
been entirely wrong. I&nbsp;see that Mr. Darwin has used a very wise
discretion in his selection, and I may now tell Professor Whitney that
he ought really to be extremely grateful that nothing except what Mr.
Darwin had approved of, was placed before the English
<span class = "pagenum">468</span>
<a name = "page468" id = "page468"> </a>
readers of the “Contemporary Review,” and therefore answered by me in
the same journal.</p>


<h5>THE PHENICIAN ALPHABET.</h5>

<p>Other charges, however, of neglect and carelessness on my part in
reading Professor Whitney’s writings, I&nbsp;can meet by a direct
negative. Among the more glaring mistakes of his lectures which I had
pointed out, was this, that fifteen years after Rougé’s discovery,
Professor Whitney still speaks of “the Phenician alphabet as the
ultimate source of the world’s alphabets.” Professor Whitney answers:
“If Professor Müller had read my twelfth lecture he would have found the
derivative nature of the Phenician alphabet fully discussed.” When I
read this, I&nbsp;felt a pang, for it was quite true that I had not read
that lecture. I&nbsp;saw a note to it, in which Professor Whitney states
that the sketch of the history of writing contained in it was based on
Steinthal’s admirable essay on the “Development of Writing,” and being
acquainted with that, I&nbsp;thought I could dispense with lecture No.
12. However, as I thought it strange that there should be so glaring a
contradiction between two lectures of the same course, that in one the
Phenician alphabet should be represented as the ultimate source, in
another as a derivative alphabet, I&nbsp;set to work and read lecture
No. 12. Will it be believed that there is not one word in it about
Rougé’s discovery, published, as I said, fifteen years ago, that the old
explanation that <i>Aleph</i> stood for an ox, <i>Beth</i> for a house,
<i>Gimel</i> for camel, <i>Daleth</i> for door, is simply repeated, and
that similarities are detected between the forms of the letters and the
figures of the objects whose names they bear? Therefore of two
<span class = "pagenum">469</span>
<a name = "page469" id = "page469"> </a>
things one, either Professor Whitney was totally ignorant of what has
been published on this subject during the last fifteen years by Rougé,
father and son, by Brugsch, Lenormant and others, or he thought he might
safely charge me with having misrepresented him, because neither I nor
any one else was likely to read lecture No. 12.</p>

<p>After this instance of what Professor Whitney considers permissible,
I&nbsp;need hardly say more; but having been cited by him before a
tribunal which hardly knows me, to substantiate what I had asserted in
my “Answer to Mr. Darwin,” it may be better to go manfully through a
most distasteful task, to answer <i>seriatim</i> point after point, and
thus to leave on record one of the most extraordinary cases of what I
can only call Literary Daltonism.</p>


<h5>LIKE AND UNLIKE.</h5>

<p>I am accused by Professor Whitney of having read his lectures
carelessly, because I had only been struck by what seemed to me
repetitions from my own writings, without observing the deeper
difference between his lectures and my own. He therefore advises me to
read his lectures again. I&nbsp;am afraid I cannot do that, nor do I see
any necessity for it, because though I was certainly staggered by a
number of coincidences between his lectures and my own, I&nbsp;was
perfectly aware that they differed from each other more than I cared to
say. I&nbsp;imagined I had conveyed this as clearly as I could, without
saying anything offensive, by observing that in many places his
arguments seemed to me like an <i>inverted fugue</i> on a <i>motive</i>
taken from my lectures. But if I was not sufficiently outspoken on that
point, I&nbsp;am quite willing to make amends for it now.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">470</span>
<a name = "page470" id = "page470"> </a>
<h5>AN INVERTED FUGUE.</h5>

<p>I must give one instance at least of what I mean by an <i>inverted
fugue</i>.</p>

<p>I had laid great stress on the fact that, though we are accustomed to
speak of language as a thing by itself, language after all is not
something independent and substantial, but, in the first instance, an
act, and to be studied as such. Thus I said (p.&nbsp;51):&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“To speak of language as a thing by itself, as living a life of its own,
as growing to maturity, producing offspring, and dying away, is sheer
mythology.”</p>

<p>Again (p. 58):&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Language exists in man, it lives in being spoken, it dies with each
word that is pronounced, and is no longer heard.”</p>

<p>When I came to Professor Whitney’s Second Lecture, and read
(p.&nbsp;35):&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Language has, in fact, no existence save in the minds and mouths of
those who use it,”</p>

<p>I felt pleasantly reminded of what I knew I had said somewhere. But
what was my surprise, when a few lines further on I read:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“This truth is sometimes explicitly denied, and the opposite doctrine is
set up, that language has a life and growth independent of its speakers,
with which men cannot interfere. A&nbsp;recent popular writer (Professor
Max Müller) asserts that, ‘although there is a continuous change in
language, it is not in the power of man either to produce or to prevent
it. We might think as well of changing the laws which control the
circulation of our blood, or of adding an inch to our height, as of
altering the laws of speech, or inventing new words according to our own
pleasure.’”</p>

<p>How is one to fight against such attacks? The very words which
Professor Whitney had paraphrased before, only substituting “skull” for
“height,” and
<span class = "pagenum">471</span>
<a name = "page471" id = "page471"> </a>
by which I had tried to prove “that languages are not the artful
creations of individuals,” are turned against me to show that, because I
denied to any <i>single</i> individual the power of changing language
<i>ad libitum</i>, I had set up the opposite doctrine, viz. that
language has a life and growth independent of its speakers.</p>

<p>Does Professor Whitney believe that any attentive reader can be taken
in by such artifices? Suppose I had said that in a well-organized
republic no individual can change the laws according to his pleasure,
would it follow that I held the opposite doctrine, that laws have a life
and growth independent of the lawgiver? The simile is weak, because an
individual may, under very peculiar circumstances, change a law
according to his pleasure: but weak as it is, I&nbsp;hope it will
convince Professor Whitney that Formal Logic is not altogether a useless
study to a Professor of Linguistics. I&nbsp;only wonder what Professor
Whitney would have said if he had been able to find in my Lectures a
definition of language (p.&nbsp;46), worthy of Friedrich Schlegel,
viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Language, like an organic body, is no mere aggregate of similar
particles; it is a complex of related and mutually helpful parts.”</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“The rise, development, decline, and extinction of language are like the
birth, increase, decay, and death of a living creature.”</p>

<p>In these poetical utterances of Professor Whitney’s we have an
outbreak of philological mythology of a very serious nature, and this
many years after I had uttered my warning that “to speak of language as
a thing by itself, as living a life of its own, as growing
<span class = "pagenum">472</span>
<a name = "page472" id = "page472"> </a>
to maturity, producing offspring, and dying away, is sheer mythology”
(I.&nbsp;p.&nbsp;51).</p>


<h5>REPETITIONS AND VARIATIONS.</h5>

<p>It is, no doubt, quite natural that in reading Professor Whitney’s
lectures I should have been struck more forcibly than others by
coincidences, which have reference not only to general arguments, but
even to modes of expression and illustrations. I&nbsp;had pointed out
some of these verbal or slightly disguised coincidences in my first
article, but I could add many more. As we open the book, it begins by
stating that the Science of Language is a modern science, that its
growth was analogous to that of other sciences, that from a mere
collection of facts it advanced to classification, and from thence to
inductive reasoning on language. We are told that ancient nations
considered the languages of their neighbors as merely barbarous, that
Christianity changed that view, that a study of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew
widened the horizon of scholars, and that at present no dialect, however
rude, is without importance to the students of the Science of Language.
Next comes the importance of the discovery of Sanskrit, and a challenge
for a place among the recognized sciences in favor of our new
science.</p>

<p>Now I ask any one who may have read my Lectures, whether it was not
very natural that I should be struck with a certain similarity between
my old course of lectures on the Science of Language, and the lectures
delivered soon after on the Science of Language at Washington? But I was
not blind to the differences, and I never wished to claim as my own what
was original in the American book.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">473</span>
<a name = "page473" id = "page473"> </a>
<p>For instance, when the American Professor says that one of the most
important problems is to find out “How we learn English,” I&nbsp;said at
once, “That’s his ane;” and when after leading us from mother to
grandmother, and great-grandmother, he ends with Adam, and
says:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“It is only the first man before whom every beast of the field and every
fowl of the air must present itself, to see what he will call it; and
whatever he calls any living creature, that is the name thereof, not to
himself alone, but to his family and descendants, who are content to
style each as their father had done before them.”</p>

<p>I said again, “That’s his ane.”</p>

<p>When afterwards we read about the large and small number of words
used by different ranks and classes, and by different writers, when we
come to the changes in English, the phonetic changes, to phonetics in
general, to changes of meaning, etc., few, I&nbsp;think, will fail to
perceive what I naturally perceived most strongly, “the leaves of memory
rustling in the dark.” I&nbsp;perceived even such accidental
reminiscences as:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "hanging">
<p><i>Old Prussian leaving behind a brief catechism</i> (p.&nbsp;215),
and,</p>

<p><i>Old Prussian leaving behind an old catechism</i>
(p.&nbsp;200);</p>

<p><i>Frisian having a literature of its own</i> (p.&nbsp;211), and
the</p>

<p><i>Frisians having a literature of their own</i> (p.&nbsp;178),</p>
</div>

<p>though, of course, no other reader could possibly perceive such
unimportant coincidences. These, no doubt, were mere accidents; but when
we consider that there is perhaps no science which admits of more varied
illustration than the Science of Language,
<span class = "pagenum">474</span>
<a name = "page474" id = "page474"> </a>
then to find page after page the same instances which one had collected
one’s self, certainly left the impression that the soil from which these
American lectures sprang, was chiefly alluvial. Of course, as Professor
Whitney has acknowledged his indebtedness to me for these illustrations,
I&nbsp;have no complaint to make, I&nbsp;only protest against his
ingratitude in representing such illustrations as mere by-work. For the
purpose of teaching and placing a difficult subject into its proper
light, illustrations, I&nbsp;think, are hardly less important than
arguments. In order to show, for instance, in what sense Chinese may be
called a <i>parler enfantin</i>, I had said:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“If a child says <i>up</i>, that <i>up</i> is to his mind, noun, verb,
adjective, all in one. It means, I&nbsp;want to get up on my mother’s
lap.”</p>

<p>What has Professor Whitney to say on the same subject?</p>

<p class = "quote">
“It is thus that, even at present, children begin to talk;
a&nbsp;radical word or two means in their mouths a whole sentence;
<i>up</i> signifies ‘Take me up into your lap.’”</p>

<p>Enough of this, if not too much. Perhaps a thousand years hence, if
any of our books survive so long, the question whether my lectures were
written by myself, or by an American scholar settled in Germany, may
exercise the critical acumen of the philologists of the future.</p>


<h5>LECTURES PRINTED IN ENGLAND ALSO.</h5>

<p>But I see there is one more charge of carelessness brought against
me, and as I promised to answer every one, I&nbsp;must at least mention
it.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“He has not even observed that my Lectures are printed and published in
England, and not only in America.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">475</span>
<a name = "page475" id = "page475"> </a>
<p>Why I ought to have observed this, I do not understand. Would it have
served as an advertisement? Should I have said that the author resided
in Canada to secure his book against the imminent danger of piracy in
England? Or does Professor Whitney suspect here too, one of those
sinister influences which he thought had interfered with the sale of his
books in England? However, whatever sin of omission I have committed,
I&nbsp;am quite willing to apologize, in order to proceed to graver
matters.</p>


<h5>THE SCIENCE OF LANGUAGE AS ONE OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES.</h5>

<p>I stand charged next not only with having read Professor Whitney’s
writings in too cursory a manner, but with actually having
misrepresented his views on the question, so often discussed of late,
whether the Science of Language should be reckoned one of the historical
or one of the physical sciences. Let us look at the facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>I had tried to show in my very first Lecture in what sense the
Science of Language might properly be called a physical, and in what
sense it might be called an historical science. I&nbsp;had given full
weight to the arguments on either side, because I felt that, owing to
the twofold nature of man, much might be said with perfect truth for one
or the other view. When I look back on what I wrote many years ago,
after having carefully weighed all that has been written on the subject
during the last fifteen years, I&nbsp;am glad to find that I can repeat
every word I then wrote, without a single change or qualification.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“The process” I&nbsp;said (p.&nbsp;49), “through which language is
settled and unsettled, combines in one the two opposite elements
<span class = "pagenum">476</span>
<a name = "page476" id = "page476"> </a>
of necessity and freewill. Though the individual seems to be the prime
mover in producing new words and new grammatical forms, he is so only
after his individuality has been merged in the common action of the
family, tribe, or nation to which he belongs. He can do nothing by
himself, and the first impulse to a new formation in language, <i>though
given by an individual</i>, is mostly, if not always, given without
premeditation, nay, unconsciously. The individual, as such, is
powerless, and the results apparently produced by him, depend on laws
beyond his control, and on the coöperation of all those who form
together with him one class, one body, or one organic whole. But though
it is easy to show that language cannot be changed or moulded by the
taste, the fancy, or genius of man, it is nevertheless through the
instrumentality of man alone that language can be changed.”</p>

<p>Now I ask any reader of Mr. Whitney’s Lectures, whether he has found
in them anything in addition to what I had said on this subject,
anything materially or even in form, differing from it. He speaks indeed
of the actual additions made by individuals to language, but he treats
them, as I did, as rare exceptions (p.&nbsp;32), and I cannot help
thinking that when he wrote (p.&nbsp;52):&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Languages are almost as little the work of man as is the form of his
skull, the outlines of his face, the construction of his arm and
hand,”</p>

<p>he was simply paraphrasing what I had said, though, as will be seen,
far more cautiously than my American colleague, because my remarks
referred to the laws of language only, not to language as a whole
(p.&nbsp;47):&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“We might think as well of changing the laws which control the
circulation of our blood, or of adding an inch to our height, as of
altering the laws of speech, and inventing new words, <i>according to
our own pleasure</i>.”</p>

<p>I cannot hope to convince Mr. Whitney, for after
<span class = "pagenum">477</span>
<a name = "page477" id = "page477"> </a>
I had tried to explain to him, why I considered the question whether the
Science of Language is to be classed as a physical or an historical
science, as chiefly a question of technical definition, he
replies:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“That I should probably consider it as more than a matter of terminology
or technical definition whether our science is an historical science,
<i>because men make language</i>, or a physical science, <i>because men
do not make language</i>.”</p>

<p>Everybody will see that to attempt a serious argument on such
conditions, is simply impossible.</p>

<p>If Professor Whitney can produce one single passage in all my
writings where I said that <i>men do not make language</i>, I promise to
write no more on language at all. I&nbsp;see now that it is Schleicher
who, according to Professor Whitney, at least, held these crude views,
who called languages natural organisms, which, without being
determinable by the will of man, arose, grew, and developed themselves,
in accordance with fixed laws, and then again grow old and die out; who
ascribed to language that succession of phenomena which is wont to be
termed life, and who accordingly classed <i>Glottik</i>, the Science of
Language, as a natural science. These are the very opinions which, with
the exception of the last, are combated in my writings.</p>

<p>I understood perfectly well what Mr. Whitney meant, when he, like
nearly all scholars before him, claimed the Science of Language as an
historical or a moral science. Man is an amphibious creature, and all
the sciences concerning man, will be more or less amphibious sciences.
I&nbsp;did not rush into print, because he took the opposite side to the
one I had taken. On the contrary, having myself laid great stress on the
fact that language was not to be treated
<span class = "pagenum">478</span>
<a name = "page478" id = "page478"> </a>
as an artful creation of the individual, I&nbsp;was glad that the
artistic element in language, such as it is, should have found so
eloquent an advocate. But I confess, I&nbsp;was disappointed when I saw
that, with the exception of a few purely sentimental protests, there was
nothing in Mr. Whitney’s treatment of the subject that differed from my
own. I&nbsp;proved this, if not to his satisfaction, at least to that of
others, by giving <i>verbatim</i> extracts from his Lectures, and what
is the consequence? As he can no longer deny his own words, he uses the
only defense which remained, he now accuses me of garbling quotations
and thus misrepresenting him. This, of course, may be said of all
quotations, short of reprinting a whole chapter. Yet to my mind the
charge is so serious, that I feel in duty bound to repel it, not by
words, but by facts.</p>

<p>This is the way in which Professor Whitney tries to escape from the
net in which he had entangled himself. In his reply to my argument he
says:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“He chooses even more than once a sentence, in order to prove that I
maintain an opinion, directly from an argument in support of the
opposite opinion; for instance, in quoting my words, ‘that languages are
almost as little the work of man as is the form of his skull,’ he
overlooks the preceding parts of the same sentence: ‘<i>as opposed</i>
to the objects which he, the linguist, follows in his researches, and
the results which he wishes to attain.’ The whole is a part of a section
which is to prove that the absence of reflection and conscious intent,
takes away from the facts of language the subjective character which
would otherwise belong to them as products of the voluntary action.”</p>

<p>Very well. We now have what Professor Whitney says that he said. Let
us now read what he really said (p.&nbsp;51):&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">479</span>
<a name = "page479" id = "page479"> </a>
<p class = "quote">
“The linguistic student feels that he is not dealing with <i>the artful
creations of individuals</i>. So far as concerns the purposes for which
he examines them, and the results he would derive from them, they are
almost as little the work of man as is the form of his skull.”</p>

<p>To render “so far as concerns the purposes” by “Gegenüber den
Zwecken, die er bei seinen Untersuchungen verfolgt,” is a strong
measure. But even thus, the facts remain as I, not as he, had stated
them. There was no garbling on my part, but something worse than
garbling on his, and all this for no purpose whatever, except for one
which I do not like to suggest. As a linguistic student Professor
Whitney feels what I had felt, ‘that we are not dealing with the artful
creations of individuals.’ What Professor Whitney may feel besides about
language, does not concern us, but it does concern us, and it does still
more concern him, that he should not endeavor to impart to scientific
language that character which, as he admits, it has not, viz., that of
being the very artful creation of an individual.</p>

<p>I am quite willing to admit, and I have done so before on several
occasions, that I may have laid too great stress on those
characteristics of the Science of Language by which it belongs to the
physical sciences. I&nbsp;have explained why I did so at the time. In
fact these are not new questions. Because I had said, as Dr. Whewell had
said before me,&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“That there are several large provinces of speculation which concern
subjects belonging to man’s immaterial nature, and which are governed by
the same laws as sciences altogether physical,”</p>

<p>it did not follow, as Professor Whitney seems to think, that I
regarded language as something like a
<span class = "pagenum">480</span>
<a name = "page480" id = "page480"> </a>
cow or a potato. I&nbsp;cannot defend myself against such
puerilities.</p>

<p>In reviewing Schleicher’s essay, “On Darwinism tested by the Science
of Language,” I&nbsp;had said:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“It is not very creditable to the students of the Science of Language
that there should have been among them so much wrangling as to whether
that science is to be treated as one of the natural or as one of the
historical sciences. They, if any one, ought to have seen that they were
playing with language, or rather that language was playing with them,
and that unless a proper definition is first given of what is meant by
nature and by natural science, the pleading for and against the
admission of the Science of Language to the circle of the natural
sciences, may be carried on <i>ad infinitum</i>. It is, of course, open
to anybody so to define the meaning of nature as to exclude human
nature, and so to narrow the sphere of the natural sciences, as to leave
no place for the Science of Language. It is also possible so to
interpret the meaning of growth that it becomes inapplicable alike to
the gradual formation of the earth’s crust, and to the slow accumulation
of the <i>humus</i> of language. Let the definition of these terms be
plainly laid down, and the controversy, if it will not cease at once,
will at all events become more fruitful. It will then turn on the
legitimate definition of such terms as nature and mind, necessity and
free-will, and it will have to be determined by philosophers rather than
by scholars. Unless appearances deceive us, it is not the tendency of
modern philosophy to isolate human nature, and to separate it by
impassable barriers from nature at large, but rather to discover the
bridges which lead from one bank to the other, and to lay bare the
hidden foundations which, deep beneath the surface, connect the two
opposite shores. It is, in fact, easy to see that the old mediæval
discussions on necessity and free-will are turning up again in our own
time, though slightly disguised, in the discussions on the proper place
which man holds in the realm of nature; nay, that the same antinomies
have been at the root of the controversy from the days when Greek
philosophers maintained that language existed <span class = "greek"
title = "phusei">φύσει</span> or <span class = "greek" title =
"thesei">θέσει</span>, to our own days, when scholars range themselves
in two hostile camps, claiming for the Science of Language a place
either among the physical or the historical branches of knowledge.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">481</span>
<a name = "page481" id = "page481"> </a>
<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“At all events we should never allow ourselves to forget that, if we
speak of languages as natural productions, and of the Science of
Language as one of the natural sciences, what we chiefly wish to say is,
that languages are not produced by the free-will of individuals, and
that, if they are works of art, they are works of what may be called a
natural or unconscious art&mdash;an art in which the individual, though
he is the agent, is not a free agent, but checked and governed from the
very first breath of speech by the implied cooperation of those to whom
his language is addressed, and without whose acceptance language, not
being understood, would cease to be language.”</p>

<p>In the first lecture which I delivered at Strassburg, I dwelt on the
same problem, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“There is, no doubt, in language a transition from the material to the
spiritual; the raw material of language belongs to nature, but the form
of language, that which really makes language, belongs to the spirit.
Were it possible to trace human language <i>directly</i> back to natural
sounds, to interjections or imitations, the question whether the Science
of Language belongs to the sphere of the natural or the historical
sciences would at once be solved. But I doubt whether this crude view of
the origin of language counts one single supporter in Germany. With one
foot language stands, no doubt, in the realm of nature, but with the
other in the realm of spirit. Some years ago, when I thought it
necessary to bring out as clearly as possible the much neglected natural
element in language, I&nbsp;tried to explain in what sense the Science
of Language had a right to be called the last and the highest of the
natural sciences. But I need hardly say that I did not lose sight,
therefore, of the intellectual and historical character of language; and
I may here express my conviction that the Science of Language will yet
enable us to withstand the extreme theories of the evolutionists, and to
draw a hard and fast line between spirit and matter, between man and
brute.”</p>

<p>Professor Whitney will see, therefore, that all that can be said, and
be justly said, against treating the Science of Language as a purely
physical science
<span class = "pagenum">482</span>
<a name = "page482" id = "page482"> </a>
was not so new to me as he expected; nay, his friends might possibly
tell him that the <i>pro’s</i> and <i>con’s</i> of this question had
been far more fully and fairly weighed before his own lectures were
published than afterwards. A&nbsp;writer on this subject, if he wishes
to win new laurels, must do more than furbish up old weapons, and fight
against monsters which owe their existence to nothing but his own heated
imagination.</p>


<h5>IS GLOTTOLOGY A SCIENCE?</h5>

<p>His knowledge of the German language ought to have kept Professor
Whitney from an insinuation that I had claimed for Glottology a place
among the physical sciences, because I feared that otherwise the title
of “science” would be altogether denied to my researches. Now whatever
artificial restriction may have been forced on the term “science” in
English and American, the corresponding term in German,
<i>Wissenschaft</i>, has, as yet, resisted all such violence, and it was
as a German that I ventured to call <i>Sprachwissenschaft</i> by its
right name in English, and did not hesitate to speak even of a Science
of Mythology, a&nbsp;Science of Religion, and a Science of Thought.</p>

<p>Finally, as to my wishing to smuggle in Glottology, and to secure for
it at least some small corner in the circle of the Physical Sciences,
I&nbsp;am afraid I cannot lay claim to such modesty. When at the meeting
of the British Association at Oxford in 1847, Bunsen claimed the
establishment of a separate section for Ethnology, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“If man is the apex of creation, it seems right on the one side, that a
historical inquiry into his origin and development
<span class = "pagenum">483</span>
<a name = "page483" id = "page483"> </a>
should never be allowed to sever itself from the general body of natural
science, and, in particular, from physiology. But on the other hand, if
man is the apex of creation, if he is the end to which all organic
formations tend from the very beginning; if man is at once the mystery
and the key of natural science; if that is the only view of natural
science worthy of our age, then ethnologic philology, once established
on principles as clear as the physiological are, is <i>the highest
branch</i> of that science for the advancement of which this Association
is instituted. It is not an appendix to physiology or to anything else;
but its object is, on the contrary, capable of becoming the end and goal
of the labors and transactions of a scientific association.”</p>

<p>These words of my departed friend express better than anything which
I can say, what I meant by claiming for the Science of Language and the
Science of Man, a&nbsp;place among the physical sciences. By enlarging
the definition of physical science so as to make it comprehend both
Anthropology and Glottology, I&nbsp;thought I was claiming a wider scope
and a higher dignity for physical science. The idea of calling language
a vegetable, in order to smuggle it through the toll-bar of the physical
sciences, certainly never entered my mind.</p>

<p>When one remembers how since 1847, man has become the central point
of the discussions of the British Association year after year, Bunsen’s
words sound almost prophetic, and it might have been guessed, even in
America, that the friend and pupil of Bunsen was not likely to abate
much in his claims for the recognition of the Science of Man, as the
highest of all sciences.</p>

<p>Have I done? Yes, I believe I have answered all that required an
answer in Mr. Darwin’s article, in Professor Whitney’s new attack in the
“Contemporary Review,” and in his Lectures. But alas! there is still a
page bristling with challenges.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">484</span>
<a name = "page484" id = "page484"> </a>
<p>Have I read not only his lectures, but all his controversial
articles? No. Then I ought.</p>

<p>Have I quoted any passage from his writings to prove that the less he
has thought on a subject, the louder he speaks No. Then I ought.</p>

<p>Have I produced any proof that he wonders that no one answers his
strictures? No. Then I ought.</p>

<p>He actually appeals to my honor. What can I do? I cannot say that I
have since read all his controversial articles, but I have read a
considerable number, and I frankly confess that on many points they have
raised my opinion of Professor Whitney’s acquirements. It is true, he is
not an original worker, but he is a hard reader, and a very smart
writer. The gall of bitterness that pervades all his writings, is
certainly painful, but that concerns him far more than us.</p>


<h5>LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT INSEPARABLE.</h5>

<p>First then, I am asked to explain what I meant by saying that
Professor Whitney speaks the loudest on subjects on which he has thought
the least. I&nbsp;could best explain my meaning, if I were to collect
all that Professor Whitney has written on the relation of language to
thought. He certainly grows most boisterous in these latitudes, and yet
he evidently has never, as yet, read up that subject, nay, he seems
convinced that what has been written on it by such dreamers as Locke,
Schelling, Hegel, Humboldt, Schopenhauer, Mansel, and others, deserves
no consideration whatever. To maintain, what every one of these
philosophers maintains, that a conception cannot be entertained without
the support of a word, would be, according to the Yale Professor, the
sheerest folly (p.&nbsp;125),&mdash;“part of that superficial and
<span class = "pagenum">485</span>
<a name = "page485" id = "page485"> </a>
unsound philosophy which confounds and identifies speech, thought, and
reason” (p.&nbsp;439).</p>

<p>I can quite enter into these feelings, for I can still remember the
mental effort that is required in order to surrender our usual view of
language, as a mere sign or instrument of thought, and to recognize in
it the realization of all conceptual thought. A&nbsp;mere dictionary
would, no doubt, seem the best answer to those who hold that thought and
language are inseparable, and to throw a stout Webster at our head might
be considered by many as good a refutation of such sheer folly, as a
slap in the face was supposed to be of Berkeley’s idealism. However,
Professor Whitney is an assiduous reader, and I do not at all despair
that the time will come when he will see what these thinkers really mean
by conceptual thought and by language, and I am quite prepared to hear
him say that “he had known all that long ago, that any child knew it,
that it was mere <i>bathos</i>, and that it was only due to a want of
clear and definitive expression, or to a want of knowledge of English,
excusable in a foreigner, if there had been so much darkening of counsel
by words without thought.” I&nbsp;shall then be told that:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“I consulted excellent authorities, and I worked these up with a
commendable degree of industry, but that I am wanting in the inner light
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and have never gained a comprehension of the movements
that go on in my own mind, without which real insight into the relation
of language to thought is <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘imposible’">impossible</ins>” (p.&nbsp;268).</p>


<h5>PROFESSOR PRANTL ON THE REFORM OF LOGIC.</h5>

<p>In order to accelerate that event, may I advise Professor Whitney to
read some articles lately published
<span class = "pagenum">486</span>
<a name = "page486" id = "page486"> </a>
by Professor Prantl? Professor Prantl is <i>facile princeps</i> among
German logicians, he is the author of the “History of Logic,” and
therefore perhaps even the American Professor will not consider him, as
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘be’">he</ins> does others
who differ from him, as quite ignorant of the first rules of logic! At
the meeting of the Royal Academy at Munich, March 6, 1875, Professor
Prantl claimed permission, after having finished his “History of Logic,”
to lay some thoughts for the “Reform of Logic,” before the members of
that Academy, the very fundamental principle of that reform being</p>

<p class = "center"><i>The essential unity of thought and
language.</i></p>

<p class = "quote">
“Realized thought, or what others might call the realization of the
faculty of thought, exists therefore in language only, and <i>vice
versâ</i>, every element of language contains thought. Every kind of
priority of real thought before its expression in language, is to be
denied, as well as any separate existence of thought” (p.&nbsp;181).</p>

<p class = "quote">
“In one sense I should not deny that there is something in animals which
in a very high degree of elevation is called language in man. In
recognition of the distance produced by this high degree of elevation,
one can agree with Max Müller, that language is the true frontier
between brute and man.” (p.&nbsp;168).</p>

<p>Or, if the Yale Professor wants a more popular treatment of the
subject, he might read Dr. Loewe’s essay on “The Simultaneity of the
Genesis of Speech and Thought,” also published this year. Dr. Loewe,
too, avails himself gladly of the new results obtained by the Science of
Language, and shows clearly that the origin of thought is the origin of
language.</p>

<p>Every one who has to write on philosophical subjects in English,
German, and French, or who has to superintend translations of what he
has written into
<span class = "pagenum">487</span>
<a name = "page487" id = "page487"> </a>
other languages, must know how difficult it is to guard always against
being misunderstood, but a reader familiar with his subject at once
makes allowance for this; he does not raise clouds of dust for nothing.
Observe the difference between some criticisms passed on what I had
said, by Dr. Loewe, and by others. I&nbsp;had said in my Lectures
(ii.&nbsp;82):&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“It is possible, without language, to see, to perceive, to stare at, to
dream about things; but, without words, not even such simple
<i>ideas</i> as white or black can be for a moment realized.”</p>

<p>My German translator had rendered <i>ideas</i> by
<i>Vorstellungen</i> while I used the word in the sense of concept,
<i>Begriff</i>. Dr. Loewe in commenting on this passage says:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“If M. M. maintains that <i>Vorstellungen</i>, such as white and black,
cannot be realized for a moment without words, he is right, but only if
by <i>Vorstellung</i> he means <i>Begriff</i>. And this is clearly his
meaning, because shortly before he had insisted on the fact that it was
conceptual thought which is impossible without words. Were we to take
his words literally, then it would be wrong, for sensuous images
(Sinnesbilder), such as white and black, do not require words for their
realization. One glance at the psychical life of animals would suffice
to prove that sensuous representation (Vorstellen) can be carried out
without language, for it is equally certain that animals have sensuous
images as that they have no words.”</p>

<p>This is the language of a well-schooled philosopher, who cares for
truth and not for controversy, <i>à&nbsp;tout prix</i>. Let us contrast
it for a moment with the language of Professor Whitney
(p.&nbsp;249):&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“This may be taking a very high view of language; it certainly is taking
a very low view of reason. If only that part of man’s superior
endowments which finds its manifestation in language is to receive the
name of reason, what shall we style the rest? We had thought that the
love and intelligence, the soul, that looks out of a child’s eyes upon
us to reward our care long before it begins to prattle, were also marks
of reason,” etc.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">488</span>
<a name = "page488" id = "page488"> </a>
<p>This is a pretty domestic idyl, but the marvelous confusion between
conceptual thought and the inarticulate signs of the affections, will,
I&nbsp;fear, remind logicians of infantine prattle with no mark of
reason about it, rather than of scientific argument.</p>

<p>It is quite clear, therefore, from this single specimen, that it
would be impossible to argue with Professor Whitney on this subject. He
returns to it again and again, his language grows stronger and stronger
every time, yet all the time he speaks like a man whom nothing shall
convince that the earth does move. He does not even know that he might
have quoted very great authorities on his side of the question, only
that they, knowing the bearings of the whole problem, speak of their
antagonists with the respect due say by Nyâya to a Sânkhya philosopher,
not with the contempt which a Brahman feels for a <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘Mle{kkh}a’ with italic {h}">Mleccha</ins>.</p>


<h5>GRAMMATICAL BLUNDERS.</h5>

<p>But let us take a subject where, at all events, it is possible to
argue with the Professor&mdash;I&nbsp;mean Sanskrit Grammar&mdash;and we
shall see again that he is most apodictic when he is least informed. He
has criticised the first volume of my translation of the Rig-Veda. He
dislikes it very much, and gives me very excellent advice as to what I
ought to have done and what I ought not. He thinks I ought to have
thought of the large public who want to know something of the Veda, and
not of mere scholars. He thinks that the hymns addressed to the Dawn
would have pleased the young ladies better than the hymns to the
Stormgods, and he broadly hints that all the <i>pièces
justificatives</i> which I give in my commentary
<span class = "pagenum">489</span>
<a name = "page489" id = "page489"> </a>
are <i>de trop</i>. A translation, such as Langlois’, would, no doubt,
have pleased him best. I&nbsp;do not object to his views, and I hope
that he or his friends may some day give us a translation of the
Rig-Veda, carried out in that spirit. I&nbsp;shall devote the remaining
years of my life to carrying on what I ventured to call and still call
the first <i>traduction raisonnée</i> of the Veda, on those principles
which, after mature reflection, I&nbsp;adopted in the first volume, and
which I still consider the only principles in accordance with the
requirements of sound scholarship. The very reason why I chose the hymns
to the Maruts was because I thought it was high time to put an end to
the mere trifling with Vedic translation. They are, no doubt, the most
difficult, the most rugged, and, it may be, the least attractive hymns,
but they are on that very account an excellent introduction to a
scholarlike study of the Veda. Mere guessing and skipping will not avail
us here. There is no royal road to the discovery of the meaning of
difficult words in the Veda. We must trace words of doubtful meaning
through every passage where they occur, and we must give an account of
their meaning by translating every passage that can be translated,
marking the rest as, for the present, untranslatable. Boehtlingk and
Roth’s excellent Dictionary is the first step in that direction, and a
most important step. But in it the passages have only undergone their
first sifting and classifying; they are not translated, nor are they
given with perfect completeness. Now if one single passage is left out
of consideration in establishing the meaning of a word, the whole work
has to be done again. It is only by adopting my own tedious, it may be,
but
<span class = "pagenum">490</span>
<a name = "page490" id = "page490"> </a>
exhaustive method that a scholar may feel that whatever work he has
done, it is done once for all.</p>

<p>On such questions, however, it is easy to write a great deal in
general terms; though it is difficult to say anything on which all
competent scholars are not by this time fully agreed. It is not for me
to gainsay my American critic that my renderings into English, being
those of a foreigner, are tame and spiritless, but I doubt, whether in a
new edition I shall change my translation, “the lights in heaven shine
forth,” for what the American Professor suggests: “a&nbsp;sheen shines
out in the sky,” or “gleams glimmer in the sky.”</p>

<p>All this, however, anybody might have written after dinner. But once
at least Professor Whitney, Professor of Sanskrit in Yale, attempts to
come to close quarters, and ventures on a remark on Sanskrit grammar. It
is the only passage in all his writings, as far as I remember, where,
instead of indulging in mere sheet lightning, he comes down upon me with
a crashing thunderbolt, and points out a real grammatical blunder. He
says it is&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“An extremely violent and improbable grammatical process to render
<em>pari tasthushas</em>, as if the reading were <em class =
"sanskrit">paritasthivâṃsas</em>. The participial form
<em>tasthushas</em> has no right to be anything but an accusative
plural, or a genitive or ablative singular; let us have the authority
for making a nominative plural of it, and treating <em>pari</em> as its
prefix, and better authority than the mere dictum of a Hindu
grammarian.”</p>

<p>Those who are acquainted with Vedic studies know that Professor
Benfey has been for years preparing a grammar of the Vedic dialect, and,
as there is plenty of work for all workers, I&nbsp;purposely left the
grammatical questions to him, confining myself in
<span class = "pagenum">491</span>
<a name = "page491" id = "page491"> </a>
my commentary to the most necessary grammatical remarks, and giving my
chief attention to the meaning of words and the poetical conceptions of
the ancient poets. If the use of the accusatival form
<em>tasthushas</em>, with the sense of a nominative, had been confined
to the Veda, or had never been remarked on before, I&nbsp;ought, no
doubt, to have called attention to it. But similar anomalous forms occur
in Epic literature also, and more than that, attention had but lately
been called to them by a very eminent Dutch scholar, Dr. Kern, who, in
his translation of the Bṛhat-Saṃhitâ, remarks that the ungrammatical
nom. plur. <em>vidushas</em> is by no means rare in the Mahâbhârata and
kindred works. If Professor Whitney had only read as far as the eleventh
hymn in the first book of the Rig-Veda, he would have met there in
<em>abibhyushas</em> an undoubted nom. plur. in
<em>ushas</em>:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse sanskrit">
tvấm devấḥ ábibhyushaḥ tujyámânâsaḥ âvishuḥ,</p>

<p class = "verse">
The gods, stirred up, came to thee, not fearing.</p>

<p>Now, I ask, was I so far wrong when I said that Professor Whitney
speaks loudest when he knows least, and that in charging me, for once at
least, with a tangible blunder, he only betrayed his ignorance of
Sanskrit grammar? In former times a scholar, after such a misfortune,
would have taken a vow of silence or gone into a monastery. What will
Professor Whitney do? He will take a vow of speech, and rush into a
North American Review.</p>


<h5>HARD AND SOFT.</h5>

<p>There are other subjects to which Professor Whitney has of late paid
much more attention than to Sanskrit Grammar, and we shall find that on
them he argues in a much gentler tone.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">492</span>
<a name = "page492" id = "page492"> </a>
<p>It is well known that Professor Whitney held curious views about the
relation of vowels to consonants, and I therefore was not surprised to
hear from him that “my view of the essential difference between vowels
and consonants will not bear examination.” He mixes up what I call the
substance (breath and voice) with the form (squeezes and checks), and
forgets that <i>in rerum naturâ</i> there exist no consonants except as
modifying the column of voice and breath, or as what Hindu grammarians
call <em>vyanjana</em>, <i>i.e.</i>, determinants; and no vowels except
as modified by consonants. In order to support the second part of this
statement, viz., that it is impossible to pronounce an initial vowel
without a slight, and to many hardly perceptible, initial noise, the
<i>coup de la glotte</i>, I had appealed to musicians who know how
difficult it is, in playing on the flute or on the violin, to weaken or
to avoid certain noises (<i>Ansatz</i>) arising from the first impulses
imparted to the air, before it can produce really musical sensations.
Professor Whitney, in quoting this paragraph, leaves out the sentence
where I say that I want to explain the difficulty of pronouncing initial
vowels without some <i>spiritus lenis</i>, and charges me with comparing
all consonants with the unmusical noises of musical instruments. This
was in 1866, whereas in 1854 I had said: “If we regard the human voice
as a continuous stream of air, emitted as breath from the lungs and
changed by the vibration of the <i>chordæ vocales</i> into vocal sound,
as it leaves the larynx, this stream itself, as modified by certain
positions of the mouth, would represent the vowels. In the consonants,
on the contrary, we should have to recognize a number of stops opposing
for a moment the free
<span class = "pagenum">493</span>
<a name = "page493" id = "page493"> </a>
passage of this vocal air.” I&nbsp;ask any scholar or lawyer, what is
one to do against such misrepresentations? How is one to qualify them,
when to call them unintentional would be nearly as offensive as to call
them intentional?</p>

<p>The greatest offense, however, which I have committed in his eyes is
that I revived the old names of <i>hard</i> and <i>soft</i>, instead of
<i>surd</i> and <i>sonant</i>. Now I thought that one could only revive
what is dead, but I believe there is not a single scholar alive who does
not use always or occasionally the terms <i>hard</i> and <i>soft</i>.
Even Professor Whitney can only call these technical terms obsolescent;
but he thinks my influence is so omnipotent that, if I had struck a
stroke against these obsolescent terms, they would have been well nigh
or quite finished. I&nbsp;cannot accept that compliment. I&nbsp;have
tried my strokes against much more objectionable things than <i>hard</i>
and <i>soft</i>, and they have not yet vanished. I&nbsp;know of no
living philologist who does not use the old terms <i>hard</i> and
<i>soft</i>, though everybody knows that they are imperfect. I&nbsp;see
that Professor Pott<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX_2" id = "tagIX_2" href
= "#noteIX_2">2</a> in one passage where he uses <i>sonant</i> thinks it
necessary to explain it by <i>soft</i>. Why, then, am I singled out as
the great criminal? I&nbsp;do not object to the use of <i>surd</i> or
<i>sonant</i>. I have used these terms from the very beginning of my
literary career, and as Professor Whitney evidently doubts my word,
I&nbsp;may refer him to my <i>Proposals</i>, submitted to the Alphabetic
Conferences in 1854. he will find that as early as that date,
I&nbsp;already used <i>sonant</i>, though, like Pott, I&nbsp;explained
this new term by the more familiar <i>soft</i>. If he will appeal to
Professor Lepsius, he will hear how,
<span class = "pagenum">494</span>
<a name = "page494" id = "page494"> </a>
even at that time, I&nbsp;had translated for him the chapters of the
Prâtiśâkhyas, which explain the true structure of a physiological
alphabet, and ascribe the distinction between k and g to the absence and
presence of voice. I&nbsp;purposely avoided these new terms, because I
doubted, and I still doubt, whether we should gain much by their
adoption. I&nbsp;do not exactly share the misgivings that a <i>surd
mute</i> might be mistaken for a <i>deaf and dumb</i> letter, but I
think the name is awkward. <i>Voiced</i> and <i>voiceless</i> would seem
much better renderings of the excellent Sanskrit terms
<em>ghoshavat</em> and <em>aghosha</em>, in order to indicate that it is
the presence and absence of the voice which causes their difference.
Frequent changes in technical terms are much to be deprecated,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIX_3" id = "tagIX_3" href = "#noteIX_3">3</a>
particularly if the new terms are themselves imperfect.</p>

<p>Every scholar knows by this time what is meant by <i>hard</i> and
<i>soft</i>, viz., <i>voiceless</i> and <i>voiced</i>. The names
<i>hard</i> and <i>soft</i>, though not perfect, have, like most
imperfect names, some kind of excuse, as I tried to show by Czermak’s
experiments.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX_4" id = "tagIX_4" href =
"#noteIX_4">4</a> But while a good deal may be said for <i>soft</i> and
<i>hard</i>, what excuse can be pleaded for such a term as <i>media</i>,
meaning originally a letter between the <i>Psila</i> and the
<i>Dasea</i>? Yet, would it be believed that this very term is used by
Professor Whitney on the page following immediately after his
puritanical sermon against my backslidings!</p>

<p>This gentle sermon, however, which Professor Whitney preaches at me,
as if I were the Pope of Comparative Philologists, is nothing compared
with what follows later. When he saw that the difference between
<i>voiced</i> and <i>voiceless</i> letters was not so novel
<span class = "pagenum">495</span>
<a name = "page495" id = "page495"> </a>
to me as he had imagined, that it was known to me even before I
published the Prâtisâkhya,&mdash;nay, when I had told him that, to quote
the words of Professor Brücke, the founder of scientific
phonetics,&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“The medias had been classed as <i>sonant</i> in all the systems
elaborated by the students of language who have studied comparative
phonology,”</p>

<p>he does not hesitate to write as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Professor Müller, like some other students of philology (who except
Professor Whitney himself?) finds himself unable longer to resist the
force of the arguments against <i>hard</i> and <i>soft</i>, and is
convinced that <i>surd</i> and <i>sonant</i> are the proper terms to
use; but, instead of frankly abandoning the one, and accepting the other
in their place, he would fain make his hearers believe that he has
always held and taught as he now wishes he had done. It is either a case
of disingenuousness or of remarkable self-deception: there appears to be
no third alternative.”</p>

<p>I call this a gentle reproof, as coming from Professor Whitney; but I
must say at the same time that I seldom saw greater daring displayed,
regardless of all consequences. The American captain sitting on the
safety-valve to keep his vessel from blowing up, is nothing in
comparison with our American Professor. I&nbsp;have shown that in 1854
the terms <i>surd</i> and <i>sonant</i> were no novelty to me. But as
Professor Whitney had not yet joined our ranks at that time, he might
very properly plead ignorance of a paper which I myself have declared
antiquated by what I had written afterwards on the same subject. But
will it be believed that in the very same lecture which he is
criticising, there occurs the following passage (ii. p.&nbsp;156<ins
class = "correction" title = "closing ) missing">):</ins>&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“What is it that changes k into g, t&nbsp;into d, p&nbsp;into b?
B&nbsp;is called a media, a&nbsp;soft letter, a&nbsp;sonant, in
opposition to P, which is called a tenuis, a&nbsp;hard letter, or a
surd. But what is meant by these terms? A&nbsp;tenuis, we saw, was so
called by the Greeks,
<span class = "pagenum">496</span>
<a name = "page496" id = "page496"> </a>
in opposition to the aspirates, the Greek grammarians wishing to express
that the aspirates had a rough or shaggy sound, whereas the tenues were
bald, slight, or thin. This does not help us much. <i>Soft</i> and
<i>hard</i> are terms which, no doubt, express an outward difference of
b and p, but they do not explain the cause of that difference.
<i>Surd</i> and <i>sonant</i> are apt to mislead; for if, according to
the old system both p and b continue to be classed as mute, it is
difficult to see how, taking words in their proper sense, a&nbsp;mute
letter could be sonant.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Both p and b are
momentary negations of breath and voice; or, as the Hindu grammarians
say, both are formed by complete contact. But b differs from p in so far
as, in order to pronounce it, breath must have been changed by the
glottis into voice, which voice, whether loud or whispered, partly
precedes, partly follows the check.”</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“But although the hardness and softness are secondary <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘quali-/ities’ at line break">qualities</ins> of <i>tenues mediæ</i>, of surd and sonant
letters, the true physiological difference between p and b, t&nbsp;and
d, k&nbsp;and g, is that in the former the glottis is wide open, in the
latter narrowed, so as to produce either whispered or loud voice.”</p>

<p>In my introduction to the “Outline Dictionary for Missionaries,”
published in 1867, I&nbsp;wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Unfortunately, everybody is so familiar with his alphabet, that it
takes some time to convince people that they know next to nothing about
the true nature of their letters. Take even a scholar, and ask him what
is&nbsp;T, and he may possibly say, a&nbsp;dental tenuis; ask him what
is&nbsp;D, and he may reply, a&nbsp;dental media. But ask him what he
really means by a tenuis or media, or what he considers the true
difference between T and&nbsp;D, and he may probably say that T is hard
and D is soft; or that T is sharp and D is flat; or, on the contrary, as
some writers have actually maintained, that the sound of D requires a
stronger impulse of the tongue than the sound of&nbsp;T: but we shall
never get an answer that goes to the root of the matter, and lays hold
of the mainspring and prime cause of all these secondary distinctions
between T and&nbsp;D. If we consult Professor Helmholtz on the same
subject, he tells us that ’the series of so-called
<span class = "pagenum">497</span>
<a name = "page497" id = "page497"> </a>
mediæ, b, d, g, differs from that of the tenues, p, t, k, by this, that
for the former the glottis is, at the time of consonantal opening,
sufficiently narrowed to enable it to sound, or at least to produce the
noise of the <i>vox clandestina</i>, or whisper, while it is wide open
with tenues, and therefore unable to sound. Mediæ are therefore
accompanied by the tone of the voice, and this may even, where they
begin a syllable, set in a moment before, and where they end a syllable,
continue a moment after the opening of the mouth, because some air may
be driven into the closed cavity of the mouth, and support the sound of
the vocal chords of the larynx. Because of the narrowed glottis, the
rush of the air is more moderate, the noise of the air less sharp than
with the tenuis, so that a great mass of air may rush at once from the
chest.”</p>

<p class = "quote">
“This to many may seem strange and hardly intelligible. But if they find
that, several centuries before our era, the Indian grammarians gave
exactly the same definition of the difference between p, t, k, and b, d,
g, such a coincidence may possibly startle them, and lead them to
inquire for themselves into the working of that wonderful instrument by
which we produce the various sounds of our alphabet.”</p>

<p>If Professor Whitney asserts&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“That I <i>repeatedly</i> will not allow that the sonant letters
<i>are</i> intonated, but only that they <i>may be</i> intonated,”</p>

<p>I have no answer but a direct negative. For me to say so, would be to
run counter to all my own teaching, and if there is anywhere a passage
that would admit of such a construction, Professor Whitney knows
perfectly well that this could be due to nothing but an accidental want
of precision in expressing myself. I&nbsp;know of no such passage.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIX_5" id = "tagIX_5" href =
"#noteIX_5">5</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum">498</span>
<a name = "page498" id = "page498"> </a>
<p>In order to leave no doubt as to the real distinction between k, t,
p&nbsp;and g, d, b, I&nbsp;quoted, for the satisfaction of Sanskrit
scholars, the technical terms by which native grammarians define so
admirably the process of their formation, the
<em>vâhya&shy;prayatna</em>, viz., <em class =
"sanskrit">vivâra&shy;śvâsâ&shy;ghoshâḥ</em>, and <em class =
"sanskrit">saṃvâra&shy;nâda&shy;ghoshâḥ</em>. Would it be believed that
Professor Whitney accuses me of having invented these long Sanskrit
terms, and to have appended them superfluously and pedantically, as he
says, to each list of synonyms? “They are found in no Sanskrit
grammarian,” he says. Here again I have no answer but a direct negative.
They are found in the native commentary on Pâṇini’s Grammar, in
Boehtlingk’s edition, p.&nbsp;4, and fully explained in the
Mahâbhâshya.</p>

<p>If one has again and again to answer the assertions of a critic by
direct negatives, is it to be wondered at that one rather shrinks from
such encounters? I&nbsp;have for the last twenty years discussed these
phonetic problems with the most competent authorities. Not trusting to
my own knowledge of physiology and acoustics, I&nbsp;submitted
everything that I had written
<span class = "pagenum">499</span>
<a name = "page499" id = "page499"> </a>
on the alphabet, before it was published, to the approval of such men as
Helmholtz, Alexander Ellis, Professor Rolleston, and I hold their <i>vu
et approuvé</i>. I had no desire, therefore, to discuss these questions
anew with Professor Whitney, or to try to remove the erroneous views
which, till lately, he entertained on the structure of a physiological
alphabet. I&nbsp;believe Professor Whitney has still much to learn on
this subject, and as I never ask anybody to read what I myself have
written, still less to read it a second time, might I suggest to him to
read at all events the writings of Brücke, Helmholtz, Czermak, to say
nothing of Wheatstone, Ellis, and Bell, before he again descends into
this arena? If he had ever made an attempt to master that one short
quotation from Brücke, which I gave on p.&nbsp;159, or even that shorter
one from Czermak, which I gave on p.&nbsp;143:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">

<p>the theory which I followed in the classification both of the Checks
and the Breathings would not have sounded so unintelligible to him as he
says it did; he would have received some rays of that inner light on
phonetics which he misses in my Lectures, and would have seen that
besides the disingenuousness or the self-deception which he imputes to
me, in order to escape from the perplexity in which he found himself,
there was after all a third alternative, though he denies it, viz., his
being unwilling to confess his own <span class = "greek" title =

<span class = "pagenum">500</span>

<h5>FIR, OAK, BEECH.</h5>

<p>I now proceed to the next charge. I am told that I am in honor bound
to produce a passage where Professor Whitney expressed his
dissatisfaction at not being answered, or, as I had ventured to express
it, considering the general style of his criticism, when he is angry
that those whom he abuses, do not abuse him in turn. He is evidently
conscious that there is some slight foundation for what I had said, for
he says that if Steinthal thought he was angry, because “he
(Mr.&nbsp;William Dwight Whitney) and his school” had not been refuted,
instead of philosophers of the last century, he was mistaken. Yet what
can be the meaning of this sentence, that “Professor Steinthal ought to
have confronted <i>the living and aggressive</i> views of others,”
<i>i.e.</i>, of Mr. William Dwight Whitney and his school?
(p.&nbsp;365.)</p>

<p>However, I shall not appeal to that; I shall take a case which, in
this tedious process of incrimination and recrimination, may perhaps
revive for a moment the flagging interest of my readers.</p>

<p>I had in the second volume of my Lectures called attention to a
curious parallelism in the changes of meaning in certain names of trees
and in the changes of vegetation recorded in the strata of the earth. My
facts were these. <i>Foraha</i> in Old High German, <i>Föhre</i> in
modern German, <i>furh</i> in Anglo-Saxon, <i>fir</i> in English,
signify the <i>pinus silvestris</i>. In the Lombard Laws the same word
<i>fereha</i> means oak, and so does its corresponding word in Latin,
<i>quercus</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, <span class = "greek" title = "phêgos">φηγός</span> in
Greek means oak, the corresponding word in Latin, <i>fagus</i>, and in
Gothic, <i>bôka</i>, means beech.</p>

<p>That is to say, in certain Aryan languages we find
<span class = "pagenum">501</span>
<a name = "page501" id = "page501"> </a>
words meaning fir, assuming the meaning of oak; and words meaning oak,
assuming the name of beech.</p>

<p>Now in the North of Europe geologists find that a vegetation of fir
exists at the lowest depth of peat deposits; that this was succeeded by
a vegetation of oak, and this by a vegetation of beech. Even in the
lowest stratum a stone implement was found under a fir, showing the
presence of human beings.</p>

<p>Putting these two sets of facts together, I said: Is it possible to
explain the change of meaning in one word which meant fir and came to
mean oak, and in another which meant oak and came to mean beech, by the
change of vegetation which actually took place in early ages?
I&nbsp;said it was an hypothesis, and an hypothesis only. I&nbsp;pointed
out myself all that seemed doubtful in it, but I thought that the
changes of meaning and the parallel changes of vegetation required an
explanation, and until a better one could be given, I&nbsp;ventured to
suggest that such changes of meaning were as the shadows cast on
language by real, though prehistoric, events.</p>

<p>I asked for an impartial examination of the facts I had collected,
and of the theory I had based on them. What do I receive from Professor
Whitney? I&nbsp;must quote his <i>ipsissima verba</i>, to show the
spirit that pervades his arguments:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“It will not be difficult,” he says, “to gratify our author by refuting
his hypothesis. Not the very slightest shade of plausibility, that we
can discover, belongs to it. Besides the serious minor objections to
which it is liable, it involves at least three impossible suppositions,
either one of which ought to be enough to insure its rejection.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“In the first place it assumes that the indications afforded by the
peat-bogs of Denmark are conclusive as regards the condition of
Europe&mdash;of all that part of it, at least, which is occupied
<span class = "pagenum">502</span>
<a name = "page502" id = "page502"> </a>
by the Germanic and Italic races; that, throughout this whole region,
firs, oaks, and beeches have supplanted and succeeded each other,
notwithstanding that we find all of them, or two of them, still growing
peaceably together in many countries.”</p>

<p>Here Professor Whitney is, as usual, ploughing with my heifer.
I&nbsp;said:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“I must leave it to the geologist and botanist to determine whether the
changes of vegetation as described above, took place in the same
rotation over the whole of Europe, or in the North only,”</p>

<p>I had consulted several of my own geological friends, and they all
told me that there was, as yet, no evidence in Central Europe and Italy
of a succession of vegetation different from that in the North, and
that, in the present state of geological science, they could say no
more. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I&nbsp;said, Let us
wait and see; Professor Whitney says, Don’t wait.</p>

<p>His second objection is his own, but hardly worthy of him.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“The hypothesis,” he says, “assumes that the Germanic and Italic races,
while they knew and named the fir-tree only, yet kept by them all the
time, laid up in a napkin, the original term for oak, ready to be turned
into an appellation for beech, when the oaks went out of fashion.”</p>

<p>This is not so. The Aryan nations formed many new words, when the
necessity for them arose. There, was no difficulty in framing ever so
many names for the oak, and there can be little doubt that the name
<span class = "greek" title = "phêgos">φηγός</span> was derived from
<span class = "greek" title = "phagô">φάγω</span>, the oak tree being
called <span class = "greek" title = "phêgos">φηγός</span>, because it
supplied food or mast for the cattle. If there remained some
consciousness of this meaning among the Greeks, and the Italians, and
Germans, then the transference of the name from the oak to the beech
would become still more easily intelligible,
<span class = "pagenum">503</span>
<a name = "page503" id = "page503"> </a>
because both the beech-nuts and the acorns supplied the ordinary mast
for cattle.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney probably had misgivings that these two objections
were not likely to carry much weight, so he adds a third.</p>

<p class = "quote">
“The hypothesis,” he says, “implies a method of transfer of names from
one object to another which is totally inadmissible; this,
namely&mdash;that, as the forest of firs gave way to that of oaks, the
meaning of fir in the word <i>quercus</i> gave way to that of oak: and
in like manner in the other case. Now if the Latins had gone to sleep
some fine night under the shade of their majestic oaks, and had waked in
the morning to find themselves <i>patulæ sub tegmine fagi</i>, they
might naturally enough have been led, in their bewilderment, to give the
old name to the new tree. But who does not see that, in the slow and
gradual process by which, under the influence of a change of climatic
conditions, one species of tree should come to prevail over another, the
supplanter would not inherit the title of the supplanted, but would
acquire one of its own, the two subsisting together during the period of
the struggle, and that of the supplanted going out of use and memory as
the species it designated disappeared?”</p>

<p>This objection was of course so obvious that I had thought it my duty
to give a number of instances where old words have been transferred, not
<i>per saltum</i>, but slowly and gradually, to new objects, such as
<i>musket</i> originally a dappled sparrow-hawk, afterwards a gun. Other
instances might have been added, such as <span class = "greek" title =
"thaptô">θάπτω</span>, the Sanskrit <i>dah</i>, the latter meaning to
burn, the former to bury. But the best illustrations are unintentionally
offered by Professor Whitney himself. On p.&nbsp;303 he alludes to the
fact that the names <i>robin</i> and <i>blackbird</i> have been applied
in America, for the sake of convenience, and under the government of old
associations, to birds essentially unlike, or only superficially like,
those to which they belong in the mother country. Of course, every
<span class = "pagenum">504</span>
<a name = "page504" id = "page504"> </a>
Englishman who settled in America knew that the bird he called
<i>robin</i> was not the old Robin Redbreast he knew in England. Yet the
two names co-existed for a time in literature, nay, they may still be
said to co-exist in their twofold application, though, from a strictly
American point of view, the supplanting American bird has inherited the
title of the supplanted Cock-Robin of England.</p>

<p>Now, I ask, was there anything in these three cheap objections that
required an answer? Two of them I had myself fully considered, the third
was so flimsy that I thought no one would have dwelt on it. Anyhow,
I&nbsp;felt convinced that every reader was competent to judge between
Professor Whitney and myself, and it certainly never entered my mind
that I was in honor bound, either to strike out my chapter on the Words
for <i>Fir</i>, <i>Oak</i>, and <i>Beech</i>, or to fight.</p>

<p>Was I then so far wrong when I said that Professor Whitney cannot
understand how anybody could leave what he is pleased to call his
arguments, unheeded? Does he not express his surprise that in every new
edition I adhere to my views on <i>Fir</i>, <i>Oak</i>, and
<i>Beech</i>, though he himself had told me that I was wrong, and when
he calls my expressed desire for real criticism a mere “rhetorical
flourish,” is this, according to the opinion of American gentlemen, or
is it not, abuse?</p>


<h5>EPITHETA ORNANTIA.</h5>

<p>Professor Whitney’s ideas of what is real criticism, and what is mere
banter, personal abuse, or rudeness are indeed strange. He does not seem
to be aware that his name has become a by-word, at least in
<span class = "pagenum">505</span>
<a name = "page505" id = "page505"> </a>
Europe, and he defends himself against the charge of abusiveness with so
much ardor that one sometimes feels doubtful whether it is all the mere
rhetoric of a bad conscience, or a case of the most extraordinary
self-deception. He declares in so many words that he was never personal
(<i>Ich bestreite durchaus, dass was ich schrieb, im geringsten
persönlich war</i>), and he immediately goes on to say that “Steinthal
burst a two from anger and rancor, and his answer was a mere outpouring
of abuse against his personality.”</p>

<p>Now I am the last person or personality in the world to approve of
the tone of Steinthal’s answer, and if Professor Whitney asks why I had
quoted it several times in public, it was because I thought it ought to
be a warning to others. I&nbsp;think that all who are interested in
maintaining certain civilized usages even in the midst of war, ought to
protest against such a return to primitive savagery, and I am glad to
find that my friend, Mr. Matthew Arnold, one of the highest authorities
on the rules of literary warfare, entertains the same opinion, and has
quoted what I had quoted from Professor Steinthal’s pamphlet, together
with other specimens of theological rancor, as extreme cases of bad
taste.</p>

<p>I frankly admit, however, that, when I said that Steinthal had
defended himself with the same weapons with which his American
antagonist attacked him, I&nbsp;said too much. Professor Whitney does
not proceed to such extremities as Professor Steinthal. But giving him
full credit so far, I&nbsp;still cannot help thinking that it was a
fight with poisoned arrows on one side, with clubs on the other. As
Professor Whitney calls for proofs, here they are:&mdash;</p>

Professor Steinthal has not, at least, according to German and English

what he calls “the impervious distance,” and acquired the power of
language, they were to say, “We have only stung you, and you have killed
us,” would they obtain much commiseration?</p>

<p>I had collected a number of <i>epitheta ornantia</i> which I had
gathered at random from Mr. Whitney’s writings, such as
<i>worthless</i>, <i>futile</i>, <i>absurd</i>, <i>ridiculous</i>,
<i>superficial</i>, <i>unsound</i>, <i>high-flown</i>,
<i>pretentious</i>, <i>disingenuous</i>, <i>false</i>, and I claimed the
honor of every one of them having been presented to me as well as to
other scholars by our American assailant. Here, for the first time,
Professor Whitney seems staggered at his own vocabulary. However, he is
never at a loss how to escape. “As the epithets are translated into
German,” he says, “he is quite unable to find the passages to which I
may refer.” This is feeble. However, without taxing his memory further,
he says that he feels certain it must be a mistake, because he never
could have used such language. He never in his life said anything
personal, but criticised opinions only. This is “the language of
simple-minded consciousness of rectitude<ins class = "correction" title
= ". invisible">.”</ins></p>

<p>What can I do? Professor Whitney ought to know his own writings
better than I do, and nothing remains to me, in order to repel the
gravest of all accusations, but to publish in the smallest type the
following Spicilegium. I&nbsp;must add that in order to do this work
once for all, I&nbsp;have complied with Professor Whitney’s request, and
read nearly all the articles with which he has honored every one of my
writings, and in doing so I believe I have at last found the
<span class = "pagenum">508</span>
<a name = "page508" id = "page508"> </a>
key to much that seemed to me before almost inexplicable.</p>

<p>Formerly I had simply acquiesced in the statement made by one of his
best friends, Professor Weber,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIX_6" id =
"tagIX_6" href = "#noteIX_6">6</a> who, some ten years ago, when
reproving Professor Whitney for the acrimony of his language,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“I believe I am not wrong when I trace it to two causes: first,
Professor Whitney found himself forced to acknowledge as erroneous and
to withdraw several of his former views and assertions, which he had
defended with great assurance, and this disturbed his equanimity;
secondly, and still more, there were the miserable political
circumstances of North America, which could not but exercise an
irritating and galling effect on so warm a patriot as Whitney, an effect
which was transferred unconsciously to his literary criticisms and
polemics, whenever he felt inclined to it.”</p>

<p>These two scholars were then discussing the question, whether the
Nakshatras or the Lunar Zodiac of the Hindus, should be considered as
the natural discovery of the Brahmans, or as derived by them, one knows
not how, from China, from Chaldæa, or from some other unknown country.
They both made great efforts, Professor Weber chiefly in Sanskrit,
Professor Whitney in astronomy, in order to substantiate their
respective opinions. Professor Weber showed that Professor Whitney was
not very strong in Sanskrit, Professor Whitney retaliated by showing
that Professor Weber, as a philologue, had attempted to prove that the
precession of the equinox was from West to East, and not from East to
West. All this, at the time, was amusing to bystanders, but by this time
both combatants have probably found out, that the hypothesis of a
foreign origin of the Nakshatras, whether Chinese or Babylonian, was
uncalled for, or,
<span class = "pagenum">509</span>
<a name = "page509" id = "page509"> </a>
at all events, is as uncertain to-day as it was ten years ago.
I&nbsp;myself, not being an astronomer, had been content to place the
evidence from Sanskrit sources before a friend of mine, an excellent
astronomer at Oxford, and after discussing the question again and again
with him, had arrived at the conviction that there was no excuse for so
violent a theory as postulating a foreign origin of the simple
triseinadic division of the Nakshatra Zodiac. I&nbsp;quite admit that my
practical knowledge of astronomy is very small,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIX_7" id = "tagIX_7" href = "#noteIX_7">7</a> but I do believe that
my astronomical ignorance was an advantage rather than a disadvantage to
me in rightly understanding the first glimmerings of astronomical ideas
among the Hindus. Be that as it may, I&nbsp;believe that at the present
moment few scholars of repute doubt the native origin
<span class = "pagenum">510</span>
<a name = "page510" id = "page510"> </a>
of the Nakshatras, and hardly one admits an early influence of
Babylonian or Chinese science on India. I&nbsp;stated my case in the
preface to the fourth volume of my edition of the Rig-Veda, and if
anybody wishes to see what can be done by misrepresentation, let him
read what is written there, and what Professor Whitney made of it in his
articles in the “Journal of the American Oriental Society.” His
misunderstandings are so desperate, that he himself at times feels
uneasy, and admits that a more charitable interpretation of what I
wanted to say would be possible. When I saw this style of arguing, the
utter absence of any regard for what was, or what might charitably be
supposed to have been, my meaning, I&nbsp;made up my mind once for all,
that that American gentleman should never have an answer from me, and in
spite of strong temptation I kept my resolve till now. A&nbsp;man who
could say of Lassen that his statements were “wholly and reprehensibly
incorrect,” because he said that Colebrooke had shown that the Arabs
received their lunar mansions from the Hindus, was not likely to show
mercy to any other German professor.</p>

<p>I find, however, by reading one of his Essays, that there is a more
special reason why, in his repeated onslaughts on me, both before and
after the Rebellion, “he thinks he may dispense with the ordinary
courtesies of literary warfare.” I&nbsp;may tell it in his own
words:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Some one (I&nbsp;may add the name, now, it was the late Professor
Goldstücker) falls fiercely upon the work of a company of collaborators;
they unite in its defense; thereupon the aggressor reviles them as a
mutual admiration society; and Müller repeats the accusation, giving it
his own indorsement, and volunteering in addition that of another
scholar<ins class = "correction" title = "” missing">.”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<span class = "pagenum">511</span>
<a name = "page511" id = "page511"> </a>
<p>I might possibly represent the case in a different light, but I am
willing to accept the <i>acte d’accusation</i> as it comes from the hand
of my accuser; nay more, I&nbsp;am quite ready to plead guilty to it.
Only let me explain how I came to commit this great offense. What is
here referred to must have happened more than ten years ago. Professor
Goldstücker had criticised the Sanskrit Dictionary published by
Professors Boehtlingk and Roth, and “the company of collaborators” had
united in its defense, only, as Professor Whitney is authorized to
assure us, “without any apparent or known concert.” Professor
Goldstücker was an old friend of mine, to whom in the beginning of my
literary career at Berlin and in Paris, I&nbsp;was indebted for much
personal kindness. He helped me when no one else did, and many a day,
and many a night too, we had worked together at the same table, he
encouraging me to persevere when I was on the point of giving up the
study of Sanskrit altogether. When Professor Goldstücker came to
England, he undertook a new edition of Wilson’s “Sanskrit Dictionary,”
and he very soon became entangled in a controversy with “the company of
collaborators” of another Sanskrit dictionary, published at the expense
of the Russian Academy. I&nbsp;do not defend him, far from it. He had a
weakness very common among scholars;&mdash;he could not bear to see a
work praised beyond its real merits, and he thought it was his duty to
set everything right that seemed to him wrong. He was very angry with
me, because I would not join in his condemnation of the St. Petersburg
dictionary. I&nbsp;could not do that, because, without being blind to
its defects, I&nbsp;considered it a most valuable performance, highly
creditable to all its collaborators;
<span class = "pagenum">512</span>
<a name = "page512" id = "page512"> </a>
nay, I&nbsp;felt bound to say so publicly in England, because it was in
England that this excellent work had been unduly condemned. This
embittered my relations with Professor Goldstücker, and when the attacks
by the company of collaborators on him grew thicker and thicker, while I
was treated by them with the greatest civility, he persuaded himself
that I had taken part against him, that I had in fact become a sleeping
partner in what was then called the “International Praise Insurance
Society.” To show him once for all that this was not the case, and that
I was perfectly independent of any company of collaborators,
I&nbsp;wrote what I wrote at the time. Nor did I do so without having
had placed before me several reviews, which certainly seemed to give to
the old saying <i>laudari a viro laudato</i> a novel meaning. Having
done what I thought I was bound to do for an old friend, I&nbsp;was
perfectly prepared to take the consequences of what might seem a rash
act, and when I was twitted with having done so anonymously, I, of
course, thought it my duty to reprint the article, at the first
opportunity, with my name. Now let it be borne in mind that one of the
chief culprits, nay, as appeared afterwards, the most eager
mischief-maker, was Professor Whitney himself, and let us now hear what
he has to say. As if he himself were entirely unconcerned in the matter,
instead of having been the chief culprit, he speaks of “cool
effrontery;” “magisterial assumption, towards a parcel of naughty boys
caught in their naughtiness;” “most discreditable;” “the epithet
outrageous is hardly too strong.” Here his breath fails him, and,
fortunately for me, the climax ends. And this, we are asked to believe,
is not loud and boisterous
<span class = "pagenum">513</span>
<a name = "page513" id = "page513"> </a>
but gentle and calm: it is in fact “the language of simple-minded
consciousness of rectitude!”</p>

<p>These gentle onslaughts were written and published by Professor
Whitney ten years ago. I&nbsp;happen to know that a kind of
<i>colportage</i> was established to send his articles to gentlemen whom
they would not otherwise have reached. I&nbsp;was told again and again,
that I ought to put an end to these maneuvers, and yet, during all these
years, I&nbsp;thought I could perfectly well afford to take no notice of
them. But when after such proceedings Professor Whitney turns round, and
challenges me before a public which is not acquainted with these
matters, to produce any of the <i>epitheta ornantia</i> I had mentioned
as having been applied by him to me, to Renan, to Schleicher, to Oppert,
to Bleek, nay, even to Bopp and Burnouf and Lassen, when with all “the
simple-minded consciousness of rectitude” he declares, that he was never
personal, then I ask, Could I remain silent any longer?</p>

<p>How hard Professor Whitney is driven in order to fix any real blame
on me, may be seen from what follows. The article in which the obnoxious
passage which, I&nbsp;was told, deprived me of any claim to the
amenities of literary intercourse occurs, had been reprinted in the
“Indische Studien,” before I reprinted it in the first volume of
“Chips.” In reprinting it myself, I&nbsp;had rewritten parts of it, and
had also made a few additions. In the “Indische Studien,” on the
contrary, it had been reprinted in its original form, and had besides
been disfigured by several inaccuracies or misprints. Referring to
these, I&nbsp;had said that it had been, as usual, very incorrectly
reprinted. Let
<span class = "pagenum">514</span>
<a name = "page514" id = "page514"> </a>
us hear what an American pleader can make out of this:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“In this he was too little mindful of the requirements of fair dealing;
for he leaves any one who may take the trouble to turn to the ‘Indische
Studien,’ and compare the version there given with that found among the
‘Chips,’ to infer that all the discordances he shall discover are
attributable to Weber’s incorrectness, whereas they are in fact mainly
alterations which Müller has made in his own reprint; and the real
inaccuracies are perfectly trivial in character and few in
number&mdash;such printer’s blunders as are rarely avoided by Germans
who print English, or by English who print German. We should doubtless
be doing Müller injustice if we maintained that he deliberately meant
Weber to bear the odium of all the discrepancies which a comparer might
find; but he is equally responsible for the result, if it is owing only
to carelessness on his part.”</p>

<p>What will the intelligent gentlemen of the jury say to this? Because
I complained of such blunders as altars being “construed,” instead of
“constructed,” “enlightoned” instead of “enlightened,” “gratulate”
instead of “congratulate,” and similar inaccuracies, occurring in an
unauthorized reprint of my article, therefore I really wanted to throw
the odium of what I had myself written in the original article, and what
was, as far as the language was concerned, perfectly correct, on
Professor Weber. Can forensic ingenuity go further? If America possesses
many such powerful pleaders, we wonder how life can be secure.</p>

<p>Having thus ascertained whence <i>illæ lacrumæ</i>, I must now
produce a small bottle at least of the tears themselves which Professor
Whitney has shed over me, and over men far better than myself, all of
which, he says, were never meant to be personal, and most of which have
evidently been quite dried up in his memory.</p>

I begin with Bopp. “Although his mode of working is wonderfully genial,
his vision of great acuteness, and his instinct a generally trustworthy
guide, he is liable to wander far from the safe track, and has done not
a little labor over which a broad and heavy mantle of charity needs to
be drawn” (I.&nbsp;208).</p>

<p class = "quote">
M<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">. </ins>Renan and myself
have “committed the very serious error of inverting the mutual relation
of dialectic variety and uniformity of speech, thus turning topsy-turvy
the whole history of linguistic development.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It may seem hardly worth while to spend any effort in refuting an
opinion of which the falsity will have been made apparent by the
exposition already given” (p.&nbsp;177).</p>

<p class = "quote">
In another place (p.&nbsp;284) M. Renan is told that his objection to
the doctrine of a primitive Indo-European monosyllabism is noticed, not
for any cogency which it possesses, but only on account of the
respectability of M.&nbsp;Renan.</p>

Lassen and Burnouf, who thought that the geographical reminiscences in
the first chapter of the Vendidad had a historical foundation, are told
that their “claim is baseless, and even preposterous” (p.&nbsp;201). Yet
what Professor Whitney’s knowledge of Zend must be, we may judge from
what he says of Burnouf’s literary productions. “It is well known,” he
says, “that the great French scholar produced <i>two or three bulky
volumes</i> upon the Avesta.” I&nbsp;know of <i>one</i> bulky volume
only, “Commentaire sur la Yaçna,” tome i., Paris, 1833, but that may be
due to my lamentable ignorance.</p>

“Professor Oppert simply exposes himself in the somewhat ridiculous
attitude of one who knocks down, with gestures of awe and fright,

(I.&nbsp;221); the incoherence and aimlessness of his reasonings
(I.&nbsp;223); an ill-considered tirade, a&nbsp;tissue of
misrepresentations of linguistic science (I.&nbsp;237). He cannot impose
upon us by his authority, nor attract us by his eloquence: his present
essay is as heavy in style, as loose and vague in expression, unsound in
argument, arrogant in tone” (I.&nbsp;238). The motive imputed to
Professor Oppert in writing his Essay is that “he is a Jew, and wanted
to stand up for the Shemites.”</p>

<p class = "quote">
If Professor Oppert is put down as a Shemite, Dr. Bleek is sneered at as
a German. “His work is written with much apparent profundity, one of a
class, not quite unknown in Germany,
<span class = "pagenum">516</span>
<a name = "page516" id = "page516"> </a>
in which a minimum of valuable truth is wrapped up in a maximum of
sonating phraseology” (I.&nbsp;292). Poor Germany catches it again on
page 315. “Even, or especially in Germany,” we are told, “many an able
and acute scholar seems minded to indemnify <ins class = "correction"

grubbings among the roots and forms of Comparative Philology by the most

of European scholars.</p>

Now on page 119 Professor Whitney very properly reproves another
scholar, Professor Goldstücker, for having laughed at the <i>German</i>
school of Vedic interpretation. “He emphasizes it,” he says, “dwells
upon it, reiterates it three or four times in a paragraph, as if there
lay in the words themselves some potent argument. Any uninformed person
would say, we are confident, that he was making an unworthy appeal to
English prejudice against foreign men and foreign ways.” Professor
Whitney finishes up with charging Professor Goldstücker, who was himself
a German&mdash;I beg my reader’s pardon, but I am only quoting from a
North American Review&mdash;with “fouling his own nest.” Professor
Whitney, I&nbsp;believe, studied in a German university. Did he never
hear of a ’cute little bird, who does to the nest in which he was
reared, what he says Professor Goldstücker did to his own?</p>

<h5>WHY I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANSWERED.</h5>

<p>Having taken the trouble of collecting these spent balls from the
various battlefields of the American general, I&nbsp;hope that even
Professor Whitney will no longer charge me with having spoken without
book. As long as he cited me before the tribunal of scholars only,
I&nbsp;should have considered it an insult to them to suppose that they
could not, if they liked, form their own judgment. For fifteen years
have I kept my fire, till, like a Chinese juggler, Professor Whitney
must have imagined he had nearly finished my outline on the wall with
the knives so skillfully aimed to miss me. But when he dragged me before
a tribunal where my name was hardly known, when he thought that by
catching the <i>aura popularis</i> of Darwinism, he could discredit me
in the eyes of the leaders of that powerful army, when he actually got
possession of the pen of the son, fondly trusting it would carry with it
the weight of the father, then I thought I owed it to myself, and to the
cause of truth and its progress, to meet his reckless charges by clear
rebutting evidence. I&nbsp;did this in my “Answer to Mr. Darwin,” and as
I did it, I&nbsp;did it thoroughly,
<span class = "pagenum">518</span>
<a name = "page518" id = "page518"> </a>
leaving no single charge unanswered, however trifling. At the same time,
while showing the unreasonableness of his denunciations, I&nbsp;could
not help pointing out some serious errors into which Professor Whitney
had fallen. Some thrusts can only be parried by <i>a-tempo</i>
thrusts.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney, like an experienced advocate, passes over in
silence the most serious faults which I had pointed out in his
“Lectures,” and after he has attempted&mdash;with what success, let
others judge&mdash;to clear himself from a few, he turns round, and
thinks it best once for all to deny my competency to judge him. And
why?</p>

<p class = "quote">
“I do not consider Professor Müller capable of judging me justly,” he
says. And why? “Because I have felt moved, on account of his
extraordinary popularity and the exceptional importance attached to his
utterances, to criticise him more frequently than anybody else.”</p>

<p>Is not this the height of forensic ingenuity? Because A has
criticised B, therefore B cannot criticise A justly. In that case A has
indeed nothing to do but to criticise B C D to Z, and then no one in the
world can criticise him justly. I&nbsp;have watched many controversies,
I&nbsp;have observed many stratagems and bold movements to cover a
retreat, but nothing to equal this. Professor Pott was very hard on
Professor Curtius, but he did not screen himself by denying to his
adversary the competency to criticise him in turn. What would Newman
have said, if Kingsley had tried to shut him up with such a remark,
a&nbsp;remark really worthy of one literary combatant only, the famous
Pastor Goeze, the critic of Lessing?</p>

<p>What would even Professor Whitney think, if I were to say that,
because I have criticised his “Lectures,”
<span class = "pagenum">519</span>
<a name = "page519" id = "page519"> </a>
he could not justly criticise my “Sanskrit Grammar?” He might not think
it good taste to publish an advertisement to dissuade students in
America from using my grammar; he might think it unworthy of himself and
dishonorable to institute comparisons, the object of which would be too
transparent in the eyes even of his best friends in Germany. Mr. Whitney
has lived too long in Germany not to know the saying, <i>Man merkt die
Absicht und man wird verstimmt</i>. But should I ever say that he was
incompetent to criticise my “Sanskrit Grammar” justly? Certainly not.
All that I might possibly venture to say is, that before Professor
Whitney undertakes to criticise my own or any other Sanskrit grammar, he
should look at §&nbsp;84 of my grammar, and practice that very simple
rule, that if Visarga is preceded by <i>a</i>, and followed by <i>a</i>,
the Visarga is dropt, <i>a</i> changed to <i>o</i>, and the initial
vowel elided. If with this rule clearly impressed on his memory, he will
look at his edition of the Atharva-Veda Prâtiśâkhya, I.&nbsp;33, then
perhaps, instead of charging Hindu grammarians in his usual style with
“opinions obviously and grossly incorrect and hardly worth quoting,” he
might discover that <em class = "sanskrit">eke spṛshṭam</em> could only
have been meant in the MSS. for <em class = "sanskrit">eke
’spṛshṭam</em>, and that the proper translation was not that vowels are
formed <i>by contact</i>, but that they are formed <i>without
contact</i>. Instead of saying that none of the other Prâtiśâkhyas
favors this opinion, he would find the same statement in the Rig-Veda
Prâtiśâkhya, Sûtra 719, page cclxi of my edition, and he might perhaps
say to himself, that before criticising Sanskrit grammars, it would be
useful to learn at least the phonetic rules. I&nbsp;had
<span class = "pagenum">520</span>
<a name = "page520" id = "page520"> </a>
pointed out this slip before, in the second edition of my “Sanskrit
Grammar;” but, as to judge from an article of his on the accent,
Professor Whitney has not seen that second edition (1870), which
contains the Appendix on the accent in Sanskrit, I&nbsp;beg leave to
call his attention to it again.</p>


<h5>WHY I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL.</h5>

<p>I am glad to say that we now come to a more amusing part of this
controversy. After I had been told that because I was attacked first,
therefore I was not able to criticise Professor Whitney’s writings
justly, I&nbsp;am next told that I ought to be very grateful for having
been attacked, nay, I&nbsp;am told that, in my heart of hearts,
I&nbsp;am really very grateful indeed. I&nbsp;must quote this passage in
full:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“During the last eight years I have repeatedly taken the opportunity
accurately to examine and frankly to criticise the views of others and
the arguments by which they were supported. I&nbsp;have done this more
particularly against eminent and famous men whom the public has
accustomed itself to regard as guides in matters referring to the
Science of Language. What unknown and uncared for people say, is of no
consequence whatever; but if Schleicher and Steinthal, Renan and Müller,
teach what to me seems an error, and try to support it by proofs, then
surely I am not only justified, but called upon to refute them, if I
can. Among these students the last-named seems to be of different
opinion. In his article, ‘My Reply to Mr. Darwin,’ published in the
March number of the ‘Deutsche Rundschau,’ he thinks it necessary to read
me a severe lecture on my presumption, although he also flatters me by
the hint that my custom of criticising the most eminent men only is
appreciated, and those whom I criticise feel honored by it.”</p>

<p>I confess when I read this, I wished I had really paid such a pretty
compliment to my kind critic, but looking through my article from
beginning to end, I
<span class = "pagenum">521</span>
<a name = "page521" id = "page521"> </a>
find no hint anywhere that could bear so favorable an interpretation,
unless it is where I speak of “the noble army of his martyrs,” and of
the untranslated remark of Phocion, which he may have taken for a
compliment. In saying that it was acknowledged to be an honor to be
attacked by him, Professor Whitney was, no doubt, thinking of the words
of Ovid, <i>Summa petunt dextra fulmina missa Jovis</i>, and I am not
going in future to deny him the title of the Jovial and Olympian critic,
nor should I suggest to him to read the line in Ovid immediately
preceding the one quoted. Against one thing only I must protest. Though
the last named, I&nbsp;am surely not, as he boldly asserts, the only one
of the four <i>sommités</i> struck by his Olympian thunderbolts, who
have humbly declined too frequent a repetition of his celestial favors.
Schleicher, no doubt, was safe, for alas, he is dead! But Steinthal
surely has uttered rather Promethean protests against the
Olympian,&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">

</div>

<p>and as to M. Renan, does his silence mean more than&mdash;</p>

<span class = "greek" title = "Emoi d’ elasson Zênos ê mêden melei">Ἐμοὶ
δ’ ἔλασσον Ζηνὸς ἢ μηδὲν μέλει</span></p>

<p>I confess, then, frankly that, in my heart of hearts, I am not
grateful for these cruel kindnesses, and if he says that the other
Serene Highnesses have been less ungrateful than I am, I&nbsp;fear this
is again one of his over-confident assertions. My publishers in America
may be grateful to him, for I am told that, owing to Professor Whitney’s
articles, much more interest in my works has been excited in America
<span class = "pagenum">522</span>
<a name = "page522" id = "page522"> </a>
than I could ever have expected. But I cannot help thinking that by the
line of action he has followed, he has done infinite harm to the science
which we both have at heart. In order to account somehow or other for
his promiscuous onslaughts, he now tells Mr. Darwin and his friends that
in the Science of Language all is chaos. That is not so, unless Mr.
Whitney is here using chaos in a purely subjective sense. There are
differences of opinion, as there are in every living and progressive
science, but even those who differ most widely, perfectly understand and
respect each other, because they know that, from the days of Plato and
Aristotle, men who start from different points, arrive at different
conclusions, particularly when the highest problems in every science are
under consideration. I&nbsp;do not agree with Professor Steinthal, but I
understand him; I&nbsp;do not agree with Dr. Bleek, but I respect him;
I&nbsp;differ most of all from Schleicher, but I think that an hour or
two of private conversation, if it were possible still, would have
brought us much nearer together. At all events, in reading any of their
books, I&nbsp;feel interested, I&nbsp;breathe a new atmosphere,
I&nbsp;get new ideas, I&nbsp;feel animated and invigorated. I&nbsp;have
now read nearly all that Professor Whitney has written on the Science of
Language, and I have not found one single new fact, one single result of
independent research, nay, not even one single new etymology, that I
could have added to my Collectanea. If I am wrong, let it be proved.
That language is an institution, that language is an instrument, that we
learn our language from our mothers, as they learned it from their
mothers and so on till we come to Adam and Eve, that language is meant
for communication, all this
<span class = "pagenum">523</span>
<a name = "page523" id = "page523"> </a>
surely had been argued out before, and with arguments, when necessary,
as strong as any adduced by Professor Whitney.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney may not be aware of this, or have forgotten it; but
a fertile writer like him ought at all events to have a good memory. In
his reply, p.&nbsp;262, he tells us, for instance, as one of his latest
discoveries, that in studying language, we ought to begin with modern
languages, and that when we come to more ancient periods, we should
always infer similar causes from similar effects, and never admit new
forces or new processes, except when those which we know prove totally
inefficient. In my own Lectures I had laid it down as one of the
fundamental principles of the Science of Language that “what is real in
modern formations must be admitted as possible in ancient formations,
and that what has been found true on a small scale may be true on a
larger scale.” I&nbsp;had devoted considerable space to the elucidation
of this principle, and what did Professor Whitney write at that time
(1865)?</p>

<p class = "quote">
“The conclusion sounds almost like a bathos; we should have called
these, not fundamental principles, but obvious considerations, which
hardly required any illustration” (p.&nbsp;243).</p>

<p>Here is another instance of failure of memory. He assures
us:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“That he would never venture to charge anybody with being influenced in
his literary labors by personal vanity and a desire of notoriety, except
perhaps after giving a long string of proofs&mdash;nay, not even then”
(p.&nbsp;274).</p>

<p>Yet it was he who said of (I. 131) the late Professor Goldstücker
that&mdash;</p>

<p class = "quote">
“Mere denunciation of one’s fellows and worship of Hindu predecessors do
not make one a Vedic scholar,”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">524</span>
<a name = "page524" id = "page524"> </a>
<p>and that, after he had himself admitted that “no one would be found
to question his (Professor Goldstücker’s) immense learning, his minute
accuracy, and the sincerity and intensity of his convictions.”</p>

<p>By misunderstanding and sometimes, unless I am greatly mistaken,
willfully closing his eyes to the real views of other scholars,
Professor Whitney has created for himself a rich material for the
display of his forensic talents. Like the poor Hindu grammarian, we are
first made to say the opposite of what we said, and are then brow-beaten
as holding opinions “obviously and grossly incorrect and hardly worth
quoting.” All this is clever, but is it right? Is it even wise?</p>

<p>Much of what I have here written sounds very harsh, I know; but what
is one to do? I&nbsp;have that respect for language and for my friends,
and, may I add, for myself, to avoid harsh and abusive words, as much as
possible. I&nbsp;do not believe in the German saying, <i>Auf einen
groben Klotz gehört ein grober Keil</i>. I have tried hard, throughout
the whole of my literary career, and even in this “Defense,” not to use
the weapons that have been used against me during so many years of
almost uninterrupted attacks. Much is allowed, however, in self-defense
that would be blamable in an unprovoked attack, and if I have used here
and there the cool steel, I&nbsp;trust that clean wounds, inflicted by a
sharp sword, will heal sooner than gashes made with rude stones and
unpolished flints.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney might still, I feel convinced, do some very useful
work, as the apostle of the Science of Language in America, if only,
instead of dealing in general theories, he would apply himself to a
critical
<span class = "pagenum">525</span>
<a name = "page525" id = "page525"> </a>
study of scientific facts, and if he would not consider it his peculiar
calling to attack the personal character of other scholars. If he must
needs criticise, would it be quite impossible for him, even in his
character of Censor, to believe that other scholars are as honest as
himself, as independent, as outspoken, as devoted at all hazards to the
cause of truth? Does he really believe in his haste that all men who
differ from him, or who tell him that he has misapprehended their
teaching, are humbugs, pharisees, or liars? Professor Steinthal was a
great friend of his, does he imagine that his violent resentment was
entirely unprovoked? I&nbsp;have had hundreds of reviews of my books,
some written by men who knew more, some by men who knew less than
myself. Both classes of reviews proved very useful, but, beyond
correcting matters of fact, I&nbsp;never felt called upon to answer, or
to enter into personal recriminations with any one of my reviewers. We
should not forget that, after all, reviews are written by men, and that
there are often very tangible reasons why the same book is fiercely
praised and fiercely abused. No doubt, every writer who believes in the
truth of his opinions, wishes to see them accepted as widely as
possible; but reviews have never been the most powerful engines for the
propaganda of truth, and no one who has once known what it is to feel
one’s self face to face with Truth, would for one moment compare the
applause of the many with the silent approval of the still small voice
of conscience within. Why do we write? Chiefly, I&nbsp;believe, because
we think we have discovered facts unknown to others, or arrived at
opinions opposed to those hitherto held. Knowing the effort one has made
one’s self in shaking off old opinions or accepting
<span class = "pagenum">526</span>
<a name = "page526" id = "page526"> </a>
new facts, no student would expect that everybody else would at once
follow his lead. Indeed, we wish to differ from certain authorities, we
wish to be criticised by them; their opposition is far more important,
far more useful, far more welcome to us, than their approval could ever
be. It would be an impossible task were we to attempt to convert
personally every writer who still differs from us. Besides, there is no
wheat without bran, and nothing is more instructive than to watch how
the millstones of public opinion slowly and noiselessly separate the one
from the other. I&nbsp;have brought my harvest, such as it was, to the
mill: I&nbsp;do not cry out when I see it ground. From my peers I have
received the highest rewards which a scholar can receive, rewards far,
far above my deserts; the public at large has treated me no worse than
others; and, if I have made some enemies, all I can say is, I&nbsp;do
not envy the man who in his passage through life has made none.</p>

<p>Even now, though I am sorry for what Professor Whitney has done,
I&nbsp;am not angry with him. He has great opportunities in America, but
also great temptations. There is no part of the civilized world where a
scholar might do more useful work than in America, by the bold and
patient exploration of languages but little known, and rapidly
disappearing. Professor Whitney may still do for the philology of his
country what Dr. Bleek has done for the languages of Africa at the
sacrifice of a lifelong expatriation, alas! I&nbsp;have just time to
add, at the sacrifice of his life.</p>

<p>But I admit that America has also its temptations. There are but few
scholars there who could or would check Professor Whitney, even in his
wildest moods
<span class = "pagenum">527</span>
<a name = "page527" id = "page527"> </a>
of asseveration, and by his command of a number of American papers, he
can easily secure to himself a temporary triumph. Yet, I&nbsp;believe,
he would find a work, such as Bancroft’s “On the Native Races of the
Pacific States of North America,” a&nbsp;far more useful contribution to
our science, and a far more permanent monument of his life, than reviews
and criticisms, however brilliant and popular.</p>

<p>It was because I thought Professor Whitney capable of rendering
useful service to the Science of Language in America that I forbore so
long, that I never for years noticed his intentional rudeness and
arrogance, that I received him, when he called on me at Oxford, with
perfect civility, that I assisted him when he wanted my help in
procuring copies of MSS. at Oxford. I&nbsp;could well afford to forget
what had happened, and I tried for many years to give him credit for
honorable, though mistaken, motives in making himself the mouthpiece of
what he calls the company of collaborators.</p>

<p>In fact, if he had arraigned me again and again before a tribunal of
competent judges, I&nbsp;should gladly have left my peers to decide
between me and my American traducer. But when he cleverly changed the
venue and brought his case before a tribunal where forensic skill was
far more likely to carry the day than complicated evidence that could be
appreciated by a special jury only, then, at last, I&nbsp;had to break
through my reserve. It was not exactly cowardice that had kept me so
long from encountering the most skillful of American swordsmen, but when
the duel was forced upon me, I&nbsp;determined it should be fought out
once for all.</p>

<p>I might have said much more; in fact, I had
<span class = "pagenum">528</span>
<a name = "page528" id = "page528"> </a>
written much more than what I here publish in self-defense, but I wished
to confine my reply as much as possible to bare facts. Professor Whitney
has still to learn, it seems, that in a duel, whether military or
literary, it is the bullets which hit, not the smoke, or the report,
however loud. I&nbsp;do not flatter myself that with regard to theories
on the nature of language or the relation between language and thought
there ever will be perfect unanimity among scholars, but as to my
bullets or my facts, I&nbsp;believe the case is different. I&nbsp;claim
no infallibility, however, and would not accept the papal tiara among
comparative philologists, even though it was offered me in such tempting
terms by the hands of Professor Whitney. In order, therefore, to satisfy
Mr. Darwin, Professor Haeckel, and others whose good opinion I highly
value, because I know that they care for truth far more than for
victory, I&nbsp;now appeal to Professor Whitney to choose from among his
best friends three who are <i>Professores ordinarii</i> in any
university of England, France, Germany, or Italy, and by their verdict I
promise to abide. Let them decide the following points as to simple
matters of fact, the principal bones of contention between Professor
Whitney and myself:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "hanging">

<p>1. Whether the Latin of the inscription on the Duilian Column
represents the Latin as spoken in 263 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span> (p.&nbsp;430);</p>

<p>2. Whether Ahura-Mazda can be rendered by “the mighty spirit”
(p.&nbsp;430);</p>

<p>3. Whether <em>sarvanâman</em> in Sanskrit means “name for
everything” (p.&nbsp;430);</p>

<p>4. Whether Professor Whitney knew that the Phenician alphabet had by
Rougé and others been
<span class = "pagenum">529</span>
<a name = "page529" id = "page529"> </a>
traced back to an Egyptian source (pp.&nbsp;430, 450, 468);</p>

<p>5. Whether Professor Whitney thought that the words <i>light</i>,
<i>alight</i>, and <i>delight</i> could be traced to the same source
(p.&nbsp;467);</p>

<p>6. Whether in the passages pointed out on p.&nbsp;434, Professor
Whitney contradicts himself or not;</p>

<p>7. Whether he has been able to produce any passage from my writings
to substantiate the charge that in my Lectures I was impelled by an
overmastering fear lest man should lose his proud position in the
creation (p.&nbsp;435);</p>

<p>8. Whether there are <i>verbatim</i> coincidences between my Lectures
and those of Professor Whitney (pp.&nbsp;425, 470&ndash;474);</p>

<p>9. Whether I ever denied that language was made through the
instrumentality of man (p.&nbsp;470);</p>

<p>10. Whether I had or had not fully explained under what restrictions
the Science of Language might be treated as one of the physical
sciences, and whether Professor Whitney has added any new restrictions
(pp.&nbsp;422 seq., 475 seq.);</p>

<p>11. Whether Professor Whitney apprehended in what sense some of the
greatest philosophers declared conceptual thought impossible without
language (p.&nbsp;484);</p>

<p>12. Whether the grammatical blunder, with regard to the Sanskrit
<em>pari tasthushas</em> as a nominative plur., was mine or his
(p.&nbsp;490);</p>

<p>13. Whether I had not clearly defined the difference between hard and
soft consonants long before Professor Whitney, and whether he has not
<span class = "pagenum">530</span>
<a name = "page530" id = "page530"> </a>
misrepresented what I had written on the subject (p.&nbsp;490);</p>

<p>14. Whether in saying that the soft consonants can be intonated,
I&nbsp;could have meant that they may or may not be intonated
(p.&nbsp;497);</p>

<p>15. Whether I invented the terms <em class =
"sanskrit">vivârasvâśâghoshâḥ</em> and <em class =
"sanskrit">saṃvâra&shy;nâda&shy;ghoshâḥ</em>, and whether they are to be
found in no Sanskrit grammarian (p.&nbsp;498);</p>

<p>16. Whether I was right in saying that Professor Whitney had
complained about myself and others not noticing his attacks, and whether
his remarks on my chapter on Fir, Oak, and Beech required being noticed
(p.&nbsp;500);</p>

<p>17. Whether I had invented the <i>Epitheta ornantia</i> applied by
Professor Whitney to myself and other scholars, or whether they occur in
his own writings (p.&nbsp;504);</p>

<p>18. Whether E. Burnouf has written two or three bulky volumes on the
Avesta, or only one (p.&nbsp;515);</p>

<p>19. Whether Professor Whitney made a grammatical blunder in
translating a passage of the Atharva-Veda Prâtiśâkhya, and on the
strength of it charged the Hindu grammarian with holding opinions
“obviously and grossly incorrect, and hardly worth quoting”
(p.&nbsp;519);</p>

<p>20. Whether Professor Whitney has occasionally been forgetful
(p.&nbsp;523).</p>
</div>

<p>Surely there are among Professor Whitney’s personal friends scholars
who could say Yes or No to any of these twenty questions, and whose
verdict would be accepted, and not by scholars only, as beyond
suspicion. Anyhow, I&nbsp;can do no more for the sake of
<span class = "pagenum">531</span>
<a name = "page531" id = "page531"> </a>
peace, and to put an end to the supposed state of chaos in the Science
of Language, and I am willing to appear in person or by deputy before
any such tribunal of competent judges.</p>

<p>I hope I have thus at last given Professor Whitney that satisfaction
which he has claimed from me for so many years; and let me assure him
that I part with him without any personal feeling of bitterness or
hostility. I&nbsp;have grudged him no praise in former days, and
whatever useful work we may receive from him in future, whether on the
languages of India or of America, his books shall always receive at my
hands the same justice as if they had been written by my best friend.
I&nbsp;have never belonged to any company of collaborators, and never
shall; but whosoever serves in the noble army for the conquest of truth,
be he private or general, will always find in me a faithful friend, and,
if need be, a&nbsp;fearless defender. I&nbsp;gladly conclude with the
words of old Fairfax (Bulk and Selvedge, 1674): “I&nbsp;believe no man
wishes with more earnestness than I do, that all men of learning and
knowledge were men of kindness and sweetness, and that such as can outdo
others would outlove them too; especially while self bewhispers us, that
it stands us all in need to be forgiven as well as to forgive.”</p>

Having still that kind of faith left, that a man could not willfully say
a thing which he knows to be untrue, I&nbsp;looked again at every
passage where I have dwelt on the difference between soft and hard
consonants, and I think I may have found the passage which Professor
Whitney grasped at, when he thought that I knew nothing of the
difference between voiced and voiceless letters, until he had
enlightened me on the subject. Speaking of letters, not as things by
themselves, but as acts, I&nbsp;sometimes speak of the process that
produces the hard consonant first, and then go on to say that it can be
voiced, and be made soft. Thus when speaking of s and z, I&nbsp;say, the
former is completely surd, the latter capable of intonation, and the
same expression occurs again. Could Professor Whitney have thought that
I meant to say that z was only capable of intonation, but was not
necessarily intonated? I&nbsp;believe he did, for it is with regard to s
and z that, as I see, he says, “it is a marvel to find men like Max
Müller, in his last lectures about language, who still cling to the old
view that a z, for instance, differs from s primarily by inferior force
of utterance.” Now, I&nbsp;admit that my expression, “capable of
intonation” might be misunderstood, and might have misled a mere tiro in
these matters, who alighted on this passage, without reading anything
before or after. But that a professor in an American university could
have taken my words in that sense is to me, I&nbsp;confess,
a&nbsp;puzzle, call it intellectual or moral, as you like.</p>

When I saw how M. Biot, the great astronomer, treated Professor Weber
<i>du haut en bas</i>, because, in criticising Biot’s opinion he had
shown some ignorance of astronomy, I&nbsp;said, from a kind of
fellow-feeling: “Weber’s Essays are very creditable to the author, and
hardly deserved the withering contempt with which they were treated by
Biot. I&nbsp;differ from nearly all the conclusions at which Professor
Weber arrives, but I admire his great diligence in collecting the
necessary evidence.” Upon this the American gentleman reads me the
following lesson: First of all, I&nbsp;am told that my statement
involves a gross error of fact; I&nbsp;ought to have said, Weber’s
Essay, not Essays, because one of them, and the most important, was not
published till after Biot’s death. I&nbsp;accept the reproof, but I
believe all whom it concerned knew what Essay I meant. But secondly,
I&nbsp;am told that the epithet <i>withering</i> is only used by
Americans when they intend to imply that, in their opinion, the subject
of the contempt is withered, or ought to be withered by it. This may be
so in American, but I totally deny that it is so in English. “Withering
contempt,” in English, means, as far as I know, a&nbsp;kind of silly and
arrogant contempt, such, for instance, as Professor Whitney displays
towards me and others, intended to annihilate us in the eyes of the
public, but utterly harmless in its consequences. But let me ask the
American critic what he meant when, speaking of Biot’s treatment of
Weber, he said, “Biot thought that Weber’s opinions had been
<i>whiffed</i> away by him as if unworthy of serious consideration<ins
class = "correction" title = "” missing">.”</ins> Does <i>whiff away</i>
in America mean more or less than <i>withering</i>? What Professor
Whitney should have objected to was the adverb <i>hardly</i>. I wish I
had said <i>vix, et ne vix quidem</i>.</p>
